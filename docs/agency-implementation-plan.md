# Federal Agency Documentation Implementation Plan

This document outlines the strategy for implementing comprehensive HMS documentation for all 115 federal agencies identified in the research. The implementation follows a phased, prioritized approach with standardized templates to ensure consistency and efficiency.

## Documentation Structure

Each agency will follow a dual-path documentation structure:

### Path 1: Domain-Specific Implementation
```
/path/to/docs/domestic/{agency_type}/{agency_id}/
```
- Focus: Agency-specific operations, programs, and domain challenges
- Audience: Agency staff, domain experts, and direct stakeholders

### Path 2: Federal Integration Implementation  
```
/path/to/docs/us/federal/{agency_id}/
```
- Focus: Cross-agency integration, interoperability, and federal ecosystem role
- Audience: Federal partners, integration teams, and cross-agency stakeholders

### Required Documentation Files

Each path requires these 7 standard files:

1. **index.md** - Overview and navigation
2. **01_agency_information.md** - Agency structure, mission, and core information
3. **02_stakeholders.md** - Comprehensive stakeholder analysis
4. **03_legacy_challenges.md** - Current challenges addressed by HMS
5. **04_use_cases.md** - HMS implementation use cases
6. **05_hms_integration.md** - Technical architecture and implementation
7. **06_getting_started.md** - Implementation guidance and resources

## Implementation Phases

The implementation is organized into 5 strategic phases:

### Phase 1: Cabinet-Level Departments (13 remaining)
- **Priority**: Highest - these are foundational agencies with broad impact
- **Timeline**: Complete within 2 weeks
- **Key Consideration**: These agencies have complex structures with multiple sub-agencies

### Phase 2: Top-Tier Independent Agencies (15 agencies)
- **Priority**: High - significant impact on federal operations
- **Timeline**: Complete within 3 weeks after Phase 1
- **Included Agencies**: EPA, CIA, NASA, SEC, FCC, FDIC, FTC, SBA, SSA, CFPB, FEMA, EEOC, OPM, NSF, NARA

### Phase 3: Second-Tier Independent Agencies (69 agencies)
- **Priority**: Medium - important but more specialized functions
- **Timeline**: Complete within 6 weeks after Phase 2
- **Approach**: Group by functional domains (financial, regulatory, administrative, etc.)

### Phase 4: Legislative and Judicial Branch Agencies (10 agencies)
- **Priority**: Medium-Low - more specialized governance structures
- **Timeline**: Complete within 2 weeks after Phase 3
- **Key Consideration**: Different governance models requiring tailored HMS approaches

### Phase 5: Quasi-Official Agencies (6 agencies)
- **Priority**: Low - specialized functions with unique structures
- **Timeline**: Complete within 1 week after Phase 4
- **Key Consideration**: Unique hybrid governance models

## Templating Strategy

To efficiently implement documentation for 115 agencies, we'll use a multi-level templating approach:

### Level 1: Agency Type Templates
- Cabinet Department Template
- Independent Agency Template
- Legislative Branch Template
- Judicial Branch Template
- Quasi-Official Template

### Level 2: Domain-Specific Templates
- Regulatory Agency Template
- Financial Agency Template
- Healthcare Agency Template
- Defense/Security Template
- Social Service Template
- Infrastructure/Transportation Template
- Environmental Template
- Economic Development Template

### Level 3: Structure Templates
- Large Multi-Component Agency
- Medium Single-Function Agency
- Small Specialized Agency

## Implementation Approach

For each phase, implement using this standardized process:

1. **Preparation**
   - Create directories for all agencies in the phase
   - Generate skeleton files using appropriate templates
   - Populate agency core information and structural data

2. **Content Development**
   - Complete domain path (domestic) documentation first
   - Complete federal integration (us/federal) path second
   - Ensure cross-referencing between paths

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Verify consistent structure and formatting
   - Ensure mermaid diagrams are properly formatted
   - Validate cross-references and links
   - Check for accurate Chain of Recursive Thoughts (CoRT) sections

4. **Continuous Integration**
   - Update implementation status and next steps after each phase
   - Update documentation index files to include new agencies
   - Review and refine templates based on lessons learned
