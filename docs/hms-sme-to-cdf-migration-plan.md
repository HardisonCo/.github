# HMS-SME to HMS-CDF Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to migrate all functionality from HMS-SME (Professional Standards Platform) to HMS-CDF (Codified Democracy Foundation). The migration will consolidate professional standards, industry knowledge, and agent collaboration frameworks into HMS-CDF, strengthening its role as the central policy verification and standards system for the HMS ecosystem.

## Rationale

1. **Consolidation of Policy & Standards**: Both HMS-SME and HMS-CDF handle aspects of standards, rules, and compliance verification, making them natural candidates for consolidation.

2. **Technical Stack Alignment**: Migrating from Ruby to Rust aligns with performance and safety goals for critical policy and standards components.

3. **Unified Verification Framework**: Combining HMS-SME's professional standards expertise with HMS-CDF's policy verification creates a more robust verification system.

4. **Simplified System Architecture**: Reducing the number of core components simplifies the overall HMS ecosystem.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Model Conversion

#### Converting HMS-SME Models to Rust

Ruby classes in `app/models/` will be converted to Rust structs and traits:

```rust
// Example: Converting Profession model
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
pub struct Profession {
    pub id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub standards: Vec<String>,
    pub skills: Vec<Skill>,
    pub market_requirements: HashMap<String, MarketRequirement>,
}

impl Profession {
    pub fn check_compliance(&self, action: &str, market_context: Option<&MarketContext>) -> ComplianceResult {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

#### Standards Data Transformation

JSON standards data will be converted to Rust-compatible structures with serde:

```rust
// Example: Standards data structure
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
pub struct Standard {
    pub id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub version: String,
    pub domain: String,
    pub requirements: Vec<Requirement>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
pub struct Requirement {
    pub id: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub validation_logic: String,
}
```

### A2A Protocol Implementation

The Agent-to-Agent protocol will be reimplemented in Rust using tokio for asynchronous communication:

```rust
// Example: A2A Client implementation
pub struct A2AClient {
    base_url: String,
    client: reqwest::Client,
}

impl A2AClient {
    pub fn new(base_url: &str) -> Self {
        Self {
            base_url: base_url.to_string(),
            client: reqwest::Client::new(),
        }
    }

    pub async fn send_task(&self, task: Task, standards: Vec<String>) -> Result<TaskResponse, A2AError> {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### Deal Flow System Integration

The Deal Flow system will be integrated into the HMS-CDF pipeline architecture:

```rust
// Example: Pipeline operation for deal flow
pub struct DealFlowOperation {
    problem: Problem,
    solution: Option<Solution>,
    players: Vec<Player>,
    transaction: Option<Transaction>,
}

impl Operation for DealFlowOperation {
    async fn execute(&self, context: &mut Context) -> Result<(), Error> {
        // Implementation that orchestrates the deal flow
    }
}
```

### Integration with Existing HMS-CDF Systems

The professional standards functionality will be integrated with existing HMS-CDF systems like the debate and simulation engines:

```rust
// Example: Integrating professional standards with policy verification
impl PolicyVerifier {
    pub fn verify_against_professional_standards(&self, policy: &Policy, profession: Option<&str>) -> VerificationResult {
        // Implementation that uses professional standards to verify policies
    }
}
```

## API Compatibility

To ensure a smooth transition, we'll implement an API compatibility layer:

```rust
// Example: Compatibility layer for HMS-SME API
#[get("/professions")]
async fn list_professions() -> impl Responder {
    let professions = get_all_professions().await;
    HttpResponse::Ok().json(professions)
}

#[post("/professions/{name}/compliance-check")]
async fn check_profession_compliance(
    path: web::Path<String>,
    data: web::Json<ComplianceCheckRequest>,
) -> impl Responder {
    // Implementation
}
```

## Data Migration Strategy

A comprehensive data migration plan will be executed:

1. **Extract**: Extract all data from HMS-SME's data directory and databases
2. **Transform**: Convert data to new Rust-compatible formats
3. **Load**: Load data into HMS-CDF storage systems
4. **Verify**: Run comprehensive validation to ensure data integrity

## Testing Strategy

Testing will focus on ensuring all functionality is preserved:

1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between components
3. **Functionality Testing**: Verify all use cases work as expected
4. **Performance Testing**: Ensure the system meets performance requirements
5. **Compatibility Testing**: Verify backward compatibility with existing systems

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Functionality gaps during migration | Implement comprehensive test coverage before starting migration |
| Performance issues | Conduct performance testing throughout development |
| Integration failures | Implement gradual transition with parallel running systems |
| Data loss or corruption | Create multiple backups and implement robust validation |
| Client disruption | Provide clear communication and backwards compatibility |

## Post-Migration Tasks

1. **Performance Optimization**: Identify and address any performance bottlenecks
2. **Documentation Update**: Ensure all documentation reflects the new unified system
3. **Training**: Provide training for developers on the new system
4. **Monitoring**: Establish monitoring for the consolidated system
5. **Feedback Collection**: Collect feedback from users and address any issues

## Timeline and Resources

Total estimated timeline: **16 weeks**

| Phase | Duration | Resources Required |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Phase 1: Analysis & Planning | 2 weeks | 2 system architects, 1 data analyst |
| Phase 2: Core Framework Implementation | 4 weeks | 3 Rust developers, 1 system architect |

## Conclusion

This migration plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for consolidating HMS-SME functionality into HMS-CDF. By following this structured approach, we can ensure a smooth transition while maintaining system integrity and improving overall architecture. The consolidated system will provide a more robust and unified foundation for policy verification, professional standards compliance, and agent collaboration across the HMS ecosystem.
