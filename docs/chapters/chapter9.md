but one barrier remains: **governance**.  
Before a single API call hits OpenAI, NSF must prove the change is:

* fair (no hidden bias),  
* legal (FedRAMP / FISMA-aligned),  
* safe (spend caps, prompt filtering), and  
* auditable (any decision replayable).

That final green-light is issued by `_ref`‚Äôs **AI Governance Framework (AIGF)**‚Äîan
embedded ethics committee that works like the FDA approving a new drug.

If AIGF *blocks* the rollout, keys stay locked and the analyst still sees the
error message. When AIGF *passes* the rollout, the ‚ÄúGenerate Research Summary‚Äù
button finally works‚Äîclosing the **system-functionality gap** for NSF.

### Supervisor Framework

The Supervisor Framework provides essential functionality in the HMS ecosystem.

## 1. Key Concepts (Beginner-Friendly)

| # | Piece | Role in the NSF ‚Äúmissing-key‚Äù story | Quick analogy |
|---|-------|--------------------------------------|---------------|
| 1 | Policy Registry | YAML rules: encryption, rotation ‚â§ 90 days, budget ‚â§ \$50/day | Law books |
| 2 | Checkpoint Engine | Runs every rule against the proposed change (new model, new key) | Airport security scanner |
| 3 | Docket & Sampling | Pulls 5-10 real prompts / responses for human + machine review | Drug trial sample group |
| 4 | Decision Gate | Returns `pass` or `fail`; red-flags halt deployment | FDA approval stamp |
| 5 | Transparency Log | Immutable ledger of each verdict | Court transcripts |

Keep these five in mind; the code & diagrams below reference them directly.

## 2. How to Use AIGF in the NSF Flow

The **moment** Carol and Dr. Lee finish their HITL approvals (Chapter 2) a
deployment bot submits the *‚ÄúEnable OpenAI provider‚Äù* change to AIGF.

### 2.1 One-Liner CLI



```text

```text


### 2.2 Equivalent API Call (‚â§ 18 lines for tutorial)



```text

```text


Typical output when things are good:



```text

```text


Inputs & Outputs tied to our use case:

* **Input** `proposal_id`: the exact package that adds the OpenAI key.  
* **Output** `status` ‚Üí `"passed"` means deployment may continue;
  `"failed"` blocks the rollout and the analyst will still see the error.

---

## 3. What Happens Internally?



```text

```text


Plain-English flow:

1. **Pull Rules** ‚Äì encryption, rotation, budget, bias.  
2. **Sample** ‚Äì run 10 dry-run prompts through GPT-4 with the *proposed* key.  
3. **Checkpoints** ‚Äì automated + human spot check.  
4. **Verdict** ‚Äì pass or fail; everything logged immutably.  
5. **Emit Event** ‚Äì successful pass unblocks the Policy Deployment pipeline.

---

## 4. Tiny Internal Code Peek (‚â§ 20 Lines)



```text

```text


Notice how:

* Rules are plain YAML ‚Üí non-coders can review.  
* Each check is a Python lambda imported dynamically.  
* Successful pass emits an event that Policy Deployment (Chapter 7) listens to.

## 5. Where AIGF Touches the HMS Map

Component | Interaction for the NSF Key Roll-Out
----------|---------------------------------------
[Human-in-the-Loop](02_human_in_the_loop_hitl_decision_maker_engagement_.md) | Supplies the *approved* proposal file.
[Verification Mechanism](08_verification_mechanism_conveyor_belt_ci_gate_.md) | Tests include **‚ÄúAIGF must pass‚Äù** as an extra gate in `verify.sh`.
[Policy Deployment](07_policy_deployment_.md) | Waits for `proposalPassed` before shipping to prod.
[Real-Time Synchronization](06_real_time_synchronization_event_broadcast_.md) | Broadcasts `governanceVerdict` so dashboards flip green immediately.
[Zero-Trust Security Model](12_zero_trust_security_model_.md) | Ensures only signed proposals reach AIGF.

---

## 6. Analogy Corner üè•

Think of AIGF as the **hospital‚Äôs ethics board**:

* Surgeons (developers) propose a new procedure (OpenAI key usage).  
* The board cross-checks best-practice guidelines, patient safety, budget.  
* Only after *every* checkbox is green can the operation proceed.  
* Paper trail stays forever for medical (audit) review.

No ethics green-light? Operation canceled‚Äîpatient stays in the waiting room
(analyst keeps seeing the error).

---

## 7. Beginner FAQ

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| ‚ÄúDo I write policies in code?‚Äù | Mostly YAML‚Äî`rotation_days: 90`, `budget_usd: 50`‚Äîthen short Python lambdas for complex checks. |
| ‚ÄúCan I override a fail?‚Äù | Yes‚Äîdesignated roles (`nsf_cio`, `nsf_ciso`) may call `POST /aigf/override`, but the action is logged and alerts leadership. |
| ‚ÄúDoes this slow us down?‚Äù | AIGF runs in **< 3 seconds** for key deployments; faster than waiting for a human committee. |

---

## 8. Summary & What‚Äôs Next

The **AI Governance Framework** is the last compliance gate that
transforms an *approved* but *inactive* OpenAI key into a *policy-sanctioned,
production-ready* feature.  
With AIGF‚Äôs green stamp, NSF staff finally see a live LLM instead of an error banner‚Äîsystem functionality restored **and** defensible.

Now that governance is in place, the next chapter zooms into the **Component
Agent**‚Äîthe tiny runtime actor that will *use* these new keys inside each micro-service.
