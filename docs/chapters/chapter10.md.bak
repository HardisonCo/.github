## Implementation Details

The following diagram illustrates the implementation architecture:

    A[Monitoring] -->|Detect Issue| B{Issue Type?}
    B -->|Performance| C[Circuit Breaker]
    B -->|Data| D[Recovery Strategy]

    C --> F[Resolution Strategy]

Here's an example implementation:

```rust
// Example: Self-Healing Circuit Breaker Implementation
use hms_core::monitoring::{HealthCheck, Status};
use hms_core::healing::{Strategy, CircuitBreaker};
use std::time::Duration;

struct DatabaseService {
    connection_string: String,
    circuit_breaker: CircuitBreaker,
}

impl DatabaseService {
    pub fn new(connection_string: &str) -> Self {
        let health_check = Box::new(move |_| {
            // Actual health check implementation
            Status::Healthy
        });
        
        let healing_strategy = Strategy::new()
            .with_retry(3, Duration::from_secs(1))
            .with_fallback(Box::new(|_| {
                // Fallback implementation
                Ok(Vec::new())
            }));
            
        let circuit_breaker = CircuitBreaker::new()
            .with_threshold(0.5)
            .with_health_check(health_check)
            .with_healing_strategy(healing_strategy);
            
        Self {
            connection_string: connection_string.to_string(),
            circuit_breaker,
        }
    }
    
    pub async fn query(&self, sql: &str) -> Result<Vec<String>, String> {
        self.circuit_breaker.execute(async {
            // Database query implementation
            Ok(vec!["result1".to_string(), "result2".to_string()])
        }).await
    }
}
```
