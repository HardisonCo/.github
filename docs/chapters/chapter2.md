The architecture in Chapter 1 showed **where** an LLM API key must live.  
This chapter explains **who** gets to *pull the trigger* and **how** HMS guarantees that a real NSF official can review, amend, or veto any change the AI proposes.

We do that with the `_ref` component‚Äîour **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) cockpit**.

## 2. Key Concepts: Understanding Human-in-the-Loop Decision Making

### HITL Decision Making

The HITL Decision Making provides essential functionality in the HMS ecosystem.

## 3. Technical Implementation: Building Human-in-the-Loop Decision Making

This section provides a detailed technical implementation guide for the Human-in-the-Loop Decision Making component:

## 1. Motivation ‚Äî The ‚ÄúAPI-Key Request‚Äù Story

Concrete use-case flow:

1. An analyst presses **Generate Research Summary**.  
2. HMS detects *no valid key* ‚Üí fires an *‚ÄúAPI-Key Provisioning Request‚Äù* event.  
3. The `_ref` cockpit places that request into a **review queue** for two people:
   * ‚ÄãCarol ‚Äî NSF Security Engineer  
   * ‚ÄãDr. Lee ‚Äî NSF Program Director  
4. Automation pauses until they both approve (quorum = 2/2).  

This solves the *system functionality* gap without sacrificing federal compliance:  
keys appear quickly, yet every action bears a human signature and audit stamp.

---

## 2. Key Concepts Breakdown

| #: | Sub-Concept | Why It Matters for NSF |
|----|-------------|------------------------|
| 2.1 | Review Queue | All pending AI suggestions (like ‚Äúadd key `openai_primary`‚Äù) show up here. |
| 2.2 | Quorum Rules | You define how many (and which) roles must approve‚Äîe.g. *1 Security + 1 Program*. |
| 2.3 | Expiry Logic | If nobody acts in 48 h, the request auto-expires; the analyst sees a clear status. |
| 2.4 | Override / Amend | Reviewers can edit scopes (`"gpt-4-turbo" ‚Üí "gpt-3.5-turbo"`) before approval. |
| 2.5 | Immutable Audit Log | Every click is timestamped and stored for later GAO audits. |

Think of `_ref` as the **autopilot disconnect switch**: automation flies the plane unless a certified pilot grabs the yoke.

---

## 3. Hands-On: Approving an API-Key Provisioning Request

Below is a 16-line Vue component (`KeyRequestReview.vue`) that lives in **HMS-GOV**.  
Carol uses it to approve the OpenAI key request.



```text

```text


‚Ä¢ **Input**: Reviewer‚Äôs verdict + rationale.  
‚Ä¢ **Output**: HMS-API locks the decision and moves the request downstream.

---

## 4. Internal Flow ‚Äì What Happens After ‚ÄúApprove‚Äù



```text

```text


Key points:

1. **Audit first** ‚Üí every decision is permanent.  
2. Key is written to the vault‚Äînever exposed in the UI.  
3. Management service receives a `KeyReady` event and retries the analyst‚Äôs original LLM call automatically.

---

## 5. Minimal Backend Endpoint (Laravel-style, 18 lines)



```text

```text


Under 20 lines, yet it:

‚Ä¢ validates permission,  
‚Ä¢ records the audit trail,  
‚Ä¢ stores the key,  
‚Ä¢ and notifies downstream services.

---

## 6. Where `_ref` Fits in the HMS Ecosystem

* Receives **Key Provisioning Requests** from the Management layer (see Chapter 1).  
* Emits `KeyReady` through [Real-Time Synchronization](06_real_time_synchronization_event_broadcast_.md).  
* Uses identity scopes provided by [Stakeholder Access Model](11_stakeholder_access_model_five_wristbands_.md).  
* Approved keys flow into [Policy Deployment](07_policy_deployment_.md) for scheduled rotation rules.  
* All clicks are logged in HMS-API, consumable by [AI Governance Framework](09_ai_governance_framework_.md).

---

## 7. Analogy Corner

Picture a **drawbridge**:

‚Ä¢ Automation = the bridge machinery.  
‚Ä¢ `_ref` reviewers = the bridge operator who checks the river traffic list.  
Only when the operator gives a thumbs-up does the bridge lift, letting ships (API keys) pass safely.

---

## 8. Recap & What‚Äôs Next

`_ref` guarantees that adding or rotating LLM API keys happens **fast, traceably, and with the right humans in charge**‚Äîeliminating the painful ‚ÄúPlease provide API keys‚Äù error while staying audit-ready for NSF.

Next, we‚Äôll see how staff actually **talk to** the AI once the keys are in place, via a universal chat entry point:

## 4. Hands-On Example: Using Human-in-the-Loop Decision Making

Below is a 16-line Vue component (`KeyRequestReview.vue`) that lives in **HMS-GOV**.  
Carol uses it to approve the OpenAI key request.

```html



<template> <div>


    <h3> API-Key Request #101</h3>


    <pre> {{ req.details }}</pre>



    <textarea v-model="note" placeholder="Why approve / reject?"/> <button @click="decide('APPROVE')">Approve</button>


    <button @click="decide('REJECT')"> Reject</button>


  </div> </template>



<script> export default {


  data(){return{req:{},note:''}},
  async created(){this.req = await fetch('/api/requests/101').then(r=> r.json())},


  methods:{
    decide(action){
      fetch(`/api/requests/101/decision`,{
        method:'POST',
        headers:{'Content-Type':'application/json'},
        body:JSON.stringify({action, note:this.note})
      });
    }
  }
}
</script

```text

‚Ä¢ **Input**: Reviewer‚Äôs verdict + rationale.  
‚Ä¢ **Output**: HMS-API locks the decision and moves the request downstream.
