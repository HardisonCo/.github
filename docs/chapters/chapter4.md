That final mile‚Äîfrom *key now available* to *draft text on screen*‚Äîis the exact slice of **system functionality** the **AI Representative Agent** covers.  
Think of it as a tireless junior analyst who:

1. Hears that a new credential is ready.  
2. Grabs the key securely.  
3. Calls the outside LLM.  
4. Hands the answer back to the analyst, fully logged and policy-compliant.

Without this agent, NSF would still be stuck at the dreaded:

Unable to generate content from LLM.

## 1. Key Concepts (What the Agent Actually Does)

| Piece | Role in the NSF flow | 1-Sentence Analogy |
|-------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Event Listener | Subscribes to `KeyReady` messages on the HMS event bus. | Doorbell that only rings when a key is activated. |
| Credential Fetcher | Pulls the fresh key from the Vault, never writes it to disk. | Unlocks a safety-deposit box, copies nothing. |
| LLM Invoker | Sends the program officer‚Äôs prompt + key to GPT / Claude / Gemini. | Places a phone call to an outside expert. |
| Response Router | Streams the LLM answer back through WebSocket to the UI. | Slides the finished memo under the office door. |
| Token Logger | Records usage so Governance can cap budget. | Time-clock punch for auditors. |

---

## 2. How Do I Use It? ‚Äì NSF One-Click Example

Once the key is approved (Chapter 2) and the dial-tone is live (Chapter 3), an NSF analyst needs only these few lines:



```text

```text


Input: a plain English prompt.  
Output: HTML draft‚Äîno key handling, no rate-limit headaches.

---

## 3. Internal Flow in the Target Use Case



```text

```text


What this diagram shows in plain words:

1. **Needs Key** ‚Äì Agent asks via the dial-tone; Vault responds.  
2. **Single Use** ‚Äì Key lives only in memory for one API call.  
3. **Answer Delivered** ‚Äì Draft flows back to the browser; usage flows to logs for auditors.

## 5. Where It Touches Other HMS Components

Component | Interaction in this Chapter
----------|----------------------------
[Three-Layer Architecture](01_three_layer_architecture_governance_management_interface_.md) | Agent sits in the **Management** layer, translating Governance rules into real calls.
[HITL Cockpit](02_human_in_the_loop_hitl_decision_maker_engagement_.md) | Only fires after reviewers approve or rotate keys.
[Collaboration Interface](03_collaboration_interface_agent_dial_tone_.md) | Provides the envelopes (`needs_key`, `llm_response`) the agent sends/receives.
[Backend API (‚ÄúHeart‚Äù / Communication Hub)](05_backend_api_heart_communication_hub_.md) | Stores token logs and exposes them for audits.
[Real-Time Synchronization](06_real_time_synchronization_event_broadcast_.md) | Streams draft_html back to the analyst in milliseconds.
[Zero-Trust Security Model](12_zero_trust_security_model_.md) | Ensures the decrypted key never leaves a trusted enclave.

## 6. Analogy Corner üì®

Picture a **courier in a secure government building**:

1. Security desk (Vault) hands the courier a sealed envelope (API key).  
2. Courier exits, makes a single phone call (LLM request).  
3. Immediately shreds the envelope, writes a note in the logbook (token usage), and hands the message to the requester (draft summary).  

Fast, logged, and nothing sensitive lingers.

---

## 7. Summary & Transition

The **AI Representative Agent** closes the loop that started with ‚Äúmissing API key,‚Äù transforming an approved credential into the actual research summary NSF staff asked for‚Äîthus restoring full **system functionality**.

Ready to see where all these messages live and how they stay queryable months later?

## 4. Hands-On Example: Using AI Representative Agents

Once the key is approved (Chapter 2) and the dial-tone is live (Chapter 3), an NSF analyst needs only these few lines:

```python


## analyst_portal_call.py   (‚â§ 16 lines)
from hms_agents.llm_client import ask_llm   # wrapper around the AI Rep Agent

def make_summary(question, user):
    return ask_llm(
        prompt = f"Generate a 300-word research summary:\n\n{question}",
        user_id = user.id           # used for quota & logging
    )

draft_html = make_summary("quantum networking grants, 2022-2024")
print(draft_html)                  # ‚Üí formatted summary ready to paste


```text

Input: a plain English prompt.  
Output: HTML draft‚Äîno key handling, no rate-limit headaches.
