# HMS Foreign Function Interface (FFI) Requirements

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a Foreign Function Interface (FFI) system across the HMS ecosystem components, enabling cross-language function calling between different technology stacks.

## 1. Core Functional Requirements

### 1.1 Function Calling Patterns

The FFI implementation must support the following function calling patterns:

- **Synchronous Calls**: Direct function calls that block until completion
- **Asynchronous Calls**: Non-blocking calls with callback or promise/future-based returns
- **Streaming Data**: Support for streaming data between components
- **Batch Processing**: Ability to batch multiple function calls for efficiency
- **Publish/Subscribe**: Event-based communication between components

### 1.2 Data Type Support

The FFI must provide consistent handling of these data types across language boundaries:

- **Primitive Types**: 
  - Integers (8, 16, 32, 64-bit, signed/unsigned)
  - Floating-point numbers (32, 64-bit)
  - Booleans
  - Strings (UTF-8 encoded)
  - Binary data (byte arrays)
  - Date/Time values

- **Complex Types**:
  - Structs/Objects/Records
  - Arrays/Lists/Vectors
  - Maps/Dictionaries/Hash Tables
  - Sets
  - Enumerations
  - Optional/Nullable types
  - Union types
  - Custom domain-specific types

- **HMS-Specific Domain Types**:
  - Healthcare-specific data structures
  - Transaction records
  - Governance policy objects
  - User/Role identity objects
  - System configuration objects

### 1.3 Error Handling

The FFI must provide robust error handling mechanisms:

- **Error Propagation**: Errors must be properly propagated across language boundaries
- **Type Safety**: Runtime type checking to prevent type mismatches
- **Exception Mapping**: Mapping between different exception models
- **Debugging Support**: Rich error information for debugging cross-language calls
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Ability to recover from errors without crashing
- **Timeout Handling**: Proper handling of timeouts for long-running operations

### 1.4 Memory Management

The FFI must address memory management concerns:

- **Ownership Semantics**: Clear definition of ownership for cross-boundary objects
- **Lifecycle Management**: Proper handling of object lifecycles and cleanup
- **Memory Safety**: Prevention of memory leaks and use-after-free errors
- **Resource Cleanup**: Guaranteed cleanup of resources across language boundaries
- **Zero/Minimal Copy**: Minimizing unnecessary data copying between languages

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Performance

- **Low Latency**: <10ms overhead for cross-language function calls
- **High Throughput**: Support for high-volume function calls (>1000 calls/second)
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal memory footprint for cross-language operations
- **Scalability**: Linear scaling with increasing load
- **Resource Utilization**: Efficient use of CPU and memory resources

### 2.2 Security

- **Isolation**: Proper isolation between components running in different languages
- **Input Validation**: Validation of all cross-boundary inputs
- **Access Control**: Granular control over which functions can be called from other languages
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of cross-language function calls
- **Sandboxing**: Ability to sandbox untrusted code execution

### 2.3 Reliability

- **Stability**: High stability with minimal crashes during cross-language operations
- **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful handling of component failures
- **Recovery**: Automatic recovery from temporary failures
- **Consistency**: Consistent behavior across all supported language boundaries
- **Version Compatibility**: Clear versioning strategy for API changes

### 2.4 Maintainability

- **Code Generation**: Automated code generation for language bindings
- **Versioning**: Support for versioned interfaces
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for all supported functions
- **Testing**: Automated testing across language boundaries
- **Monitoring**: Instrumentation for monitoring cross-language calls
