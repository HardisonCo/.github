| 4    | Review & Testing | Integration tests, cross-language validation | All | All |

### Phase 2: High-Priority Components (Weeks 5-8)

These components have high business value and are needed for key system functions.

| Week | Component | Proto Files | Primary Language | Secondary Languages |
|------|-----------|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 5    | HMS-SKL   | skill.proto, capability.proto | TypeScript | Python, Rust |

| 8    | HMS-ACT   | action.proto, workflow.proto | TypeScript | Python, PHP |
| 8    | HMS-RED   | security.proto, redaction.proto | Rust | Go, PHP |

### Phase 3: Medium-Priority Components (Weeks 9-12)

These components provide important but non-critical functionality.

| Week | Component | Proto Files | Primary Language | Secondary Languages |
|------|-----------|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 9    | HMS-CUR   | currency.proto, transaction.proto | Ruby | PHP, Go |
| 9    | HMS-ESQ   | query.proto, result.proto | Go | TypeScript, Python |
| 10   | HMS-FLD   | field.proto, operation.proto | TypeScript | PHP, Ruby |
| 10   | HMS-MFE   | frontend.proto, component.proto | TypeScript | Rust, PHP |
| 11   | HMS-OPS   | operation.proto, monitoring.proto | Go | Rust, Python |
| 11   | HMS-SCM   | supply.proto, logistics.proto | PHP | Ruby, Go |
| 12   | HMS-EDU   | course.proto, curriculum.proto | Ruby | PHP, TypeScript |
| 12   | HMS-SME   | expertise.proto, domain.proto | Python | TypeScript, PHP |

### Phase 4: Low-Priority Components (Weeks 13-16)

These components are useful but not critical for system operation.

| Week | Component | Proto Files | Primary Language | Secondary Languages |
|------|-----------|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| 13   | HMS-DEV   | tools.proto, debugging.proto | TypeScript | Python, Rust |
| 14   | HMS-DOC   | document.proto, generator.proto | Python | TypeScript, Ruby |
| 15   | HMS-MKT   | campaign.proto, analytics.proto | PHP | Ruby, TypeScript |
| 16   | HMS-UTL   | utility.proto, helper.proto | Go | Python, Rust |

### Phase 5: Final Integration and Testing (Weeks 17-18)

| Week | Activity | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 17   | Integration Testing | Verify cross-component FFI functionality |
| 17   | Performance Testing | Measure and optimize FFI performance |
| 18   | Documentation | Complete all documentation and usage examples |
| 18   | Final Review | Address any remaining issues or gaps |

## Weekly Task Breakdown

For each component implementation week, the following tasks should be completed:

### Day 1-2: Proto Definition
- Create message definitions
- Define service interfaces
- Review with stakeholders
- Finalize proto files

### Day 3-4: Primary Language Binding
- Generate code for primary language
- Create wrapper classes/interfaces
- Write unit tests
- Document usage

### Day 5: Secondary Language Bindings
- Generate code for secondary languages
- Verify cross-language compatibility
- Implement basic examples

### Throughout: Integration & Testing
- Continuous integration with component code
- Test serialization/deserialization
- Test cross-language calls
- Document any issues or limitations

## Resource Allocation

### Engineering Resources

| Team | Responsibility | Team Size |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| Proto Definition | Create and review proto files | 2 engineers |
| Go Implementation | Go language bindings and integration | 1 engineer |
| Rust Implementation | Rust language bindings and integration | 1 engineer |
| Python Implementation | Python language bindings and integration | 1 engineer |
| PHP Implementation | PHP language bindings and integration | 1 engineer |
| TypeScript Implementation | TypeScript/JavaScript bindings and integration | 1 engineer |
| Ruby Implementation | Ruby language bindings and integration | 1 engineer |
| QA | Testing and validation | 2 engineers |

### Support Resources

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Project Manager | Coordinate implementation, track progress |
| Technical Writer | Document APIs, create examples, maintain docs |
| DevOps | Set up build pipelines, manage dependencies |

## Milestones and Deliverables

| Milestone | Week | Deliverables |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Phase 1 Complete | Week 4 | Critical component protos and bindings |
| Phase 2 Complete | Week 8 | High-priority component protos and bindings |
| Phase 3 Complete | Week 12 | Medium-priority component protos and bindings |
| Phase 4 Complete | Week 16 | Low-priority component protos and bindings |
| Project Complete | Week 18 | All components integrated with documentation |

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Component complexity underestimated | Flexible resource allocation, prioritize critical interfaces |
| Cross-language compatibility issues | Standardized testing, early integration testing |
| Component dependencies not identified | Regular architecture reviews, dependency mapping |
| Resource constraints | Clear prioritization, ability to adjust schedule |
| Knowledge gaps in specific languages | Cross-training, technical documentation |

## Conclusion

This implementation schedule provides a structured approach to creating FFI definitions for all HMS system components. By following this phased approach with clear priorities, we can ensure that the most critical components are implemented first while managing the complexity of the overall project.

The schedule is designed to be flexible, allowing for adjustments as we learn more about each component's requirements and any unforeseen challenges that may arise during implementation.
