## 2. Phase 1: Detailed Tasks

**1.1 Infrastructure Setup**
- Scaffold multi-layer repository:
  - `core/`, `agents/`, `analysis/`, `applications/` directories
  - Git workflows, branch policies, CI pipelines

**1.2 Economic Domain Formalization**
- Author Lean definitions for core axioms (utility, equilibrium, welfare)
- Design economic DSL extension in Lean
- Establish translation layer stubs (TS/Rust FFI schemas)

**1.3 Base Agent Framework**
- Define `TheoremProvingAgent` interface (genome, prove, evolve)
- Implement genome representation and basic GA operations
- Set up test harness for agent evaluation on simple lemmas

**1.4 Initial Evaluation Framework**
- Define fitness metrics (correctness, elegance, insight)
- Create benchmarking suite for toy theorems
- Integrate metrics collection and reporting

---

## 3. Next Steps
1. Review and approve this implementation framework.
2. Kick off Phase 1 by scaffolding the repository structure.
3. Schedule weekly check-ins for progress and risk mitigation.

Once Phase 1 scaffolding is complete, the team will proceed to implement core components in an iterative cycle.

# Unified Economic Theorem-Proving & MAS Self-Healing Strategy (2024-2026)

> **Status:** _Draft v0.1 added 2024-06-##_ – Consolidates and supersedes scattered planning notes across the repo.

## Part I – Implementation Planning Framework

### Guiding Principles
1. **Modular Development** – Each subsystem (Genetic Agents, Economic Domain Formalization, Repository Analysis, MAS A2A layer, DeepSeek-Prover integration) has clear interfaces and can be shipped/tested independently.
2. **Iterative & Incremental Execution** – Each phase delivers a runnable vertical slice (even if simplified) so CI stays green.
3. **Multi-Agent Collaboration (A2A)** – Hierarchical supervisor ↔ specialised agents coordinated via lightweight event bus (NATS / Redis streams).  Agents self-describe via a discovery protocol and exchange proof artefacts.
4. **Continuous Verification & Optimization** – CI pipeline re-proves a baseline corpus of economic theorems on every PR; GA fitness & Lean verification metrics published to Prometheus.
5. **Human-in-the-Loop Governance** – Bi-weekly steering review; dashboard exposes override hooks.

### Objectives per Release Train
| Release | Target Date | MVP Goal |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **R0 – "Hello World"** | +3 months | Trivial equilibrium lemma proved end-to-end via 2 agents + Lean verification |
| **R1 – "Core MAS"**   | +8 months | Six specialised agents, repository gap-analysis, 10+ economic theorems proved |
| **R2 – "Self-Healing"**| +12 months| Supervisor spawns/retire agents based on failure telemetry; ≥30 theorems |
| **R3 – "Meta-Evolution"** | +18 months | GA evolves its own operators; RL rewards integrated; complex welfare theorem solved |
| **R4 – "Prod Launch"** | +24 months | Public API & docs; external economists run proofs in the wild |

### Phase Deliverables (applies to every phase)
* **Code artefacts** in Rust + TS packages, published to internal registry
* **Technical docs** – updated ADRs, sequence diagrams
* **Metrics dashboards** – proof success-rate, Lean CPU time, GA diversity index
* **Demo scenario** under `demo-mode/`

## Part II – Step-by-Step Implementation

Below is the expanded task list that operationalises Phases 1-5 from the roadmap.  Each bullet maps to Jira epics (placeholder IDs).

### PHASE 1 – Foundation (0-3 mo)
* _MAS Environment & A2A_
  * EP-01 • design message schema (ProtoBuf `ProofMsg`)
  * EP-02 • implement Supervisor (Rust `tokio`, WebSocket control plane)
* _Economic Domain Formalisation_
  * EP-03 • Lean definitions `Utility`, `Preference`, `CompetitiveEq`  
    baseline proof: **Edgeworth box equilibrium existence**
* _Prototype Genetic Agent_
  * EP-04 • genome schema (`strategy_genes`, `search_depth`, etc.)
  * EP-05 • fitness = binary verify pass/fail
* _Repo Analysis Foundation_
  * EP-06 • minimal Postgres store `theorems(id, status, lean_path)`

_Milestone M1: foundation_demo_ – CI target `make foundation_demo` finishes green.

### PHASE 2 – Core System (4-8 mo)
* GA enhancements (crossover, adaptive mutation)
* Specialised agents (Axiom, Decomposition, ProofStrategy …)
* Repository gap-detection & suggestion engine
* Proof generation pipeline wiring

_Milestone M2: core_mas_demo_ – Mid-complex theorem proved automatically.

### PHASE 3 – Integration & Self-Healing (9-12 mo)
* Supervisor monitors agent failure rate ➜ triggers genome mutation/spawn
* Parallel proving on k8s Job runner; proof cache via Redis
* Library expansion to 50+ theorems

_Milestone M3: self_healing_demo_ – System adapts to repeated failures.

### PHASE 4 – Advanced Learning (13-18 mo)
* Meta-evolution of GA params
* RL reward shaping linked to DeepSeek CoT traces
* Swarm-proving negotiation protocol (RAFT-backed consensus on lemma ownership)

### PHASE 5 – Application & Ecosystem (19-24 mo)
* Policy-analysis CLI tools
* Community plugin SDK
* Continuous learning & trend-analysis services

---

### Continuous Optimization Loop (post-launch)
1. Ingest new theorem specs via exporter → Lean translator.
2. GA assesses unsolved proofs → breeds niche agents.
3. MAS supervisor rebalances resources; FFI diff patches shipped via CLI.
4. Metrics close-the-loop into KPI dashboards & Steering review.
