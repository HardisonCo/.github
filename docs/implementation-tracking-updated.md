## Next Steps

### 1. LLM Integration
The system now integrates with OpenAI via the `OpenAIClient`, replacing all placeholder logic with actual LLM-based extraction and analysis.
- [x] Implement LLM client for API calls
- [x] Convert IdentifyAbstractions placeholders to use actual LLM
- [x] Convert AnalyzeRelationships placeholders to use actual LLM
- [x] Add validation and error handling for LLM responses

### 2. External Repository Integration
To complete the functionality of finding and incorporating external OSS solutions:

- [x] Implement GitHub API client for repository search
- [x] Add repository cloning functionality
- [ ] Create compatibility and licensing analysis tools
- [ ] Implement workflow for integrating external solutions

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline
To automate the concept mapping process:

- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow for HMS repositories
- [ ] Implement incremental update logic for efficient processing
- [ ] Add automated notifications for newly detected gaps
- [ ] Create visualization for concept map evolution over time

## Current Status

We have successfully implemented the core structure of the concept analyzer system in Rust, including:

1. Efficient file collection with concurrent processing
2. Abstraction identification framework (with placeholders for LLM)
3. Relationship analysis framework (with placeholders for LLM)
4. Concept registry for merging and tracking abstractions across repos
5. Gap detection algorithm to identify ecosystem gaps
6. CLI interface for analysis operations

The system has a solid foundation that allows us to:
- Process multiple repositories in parallel
- Extract and manage abstract concepts
- Identify relationships between concepts
- Detect gaps in functionality
- Store and version the conceptual map
  
The next phase will focus on enhancing the accuracy and intelligence of the system by integrating with LLM services and external repository search capabilities.
