# Economic Theorem Prover: Comprehensive Implementation Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

This comprehensive implementation plan outlines a multi-phase approach to develop a robust Economic Theorem Proving (ETP) ecosystem that leverages DeepSeek-Prover-V2's formal verification capabilities for economic models. The system integrates three core components:

1. **Economic Theorem Prover (ETP)**: A formal verification engine based on DeepSeek-Prover-V2 customized for economic theorems.
2. **Agent Framework**: A hierarchical agent architecture for economic reasoning and theorem generation.
3. **Genetic Optimization Layer**: An evolutionary system for continually improving economic models and theorems.

The implementation follows a recursive, self-improving approach where formal verification capabilities enhance agent reasoning, while genetic optimization improves the system's performance over time.
