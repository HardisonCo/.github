# Economic Formal Verification Framework

This document outlines the formal verification framework for economic models, particularly focused on deal structures, win-win calculations, and value distribution mechanisms within the HMS ecosystem.

## 1. Introduction

The Economic Formal Verification Framework provides a structured approach to proving the correctness, fairness, and optimality of economic models and deal structures. By leveraging formal methods adapted from DeepSeek-Prover-V2 and tailored for economic problems, this framework enables rigorous mathematical verification of economic properties.

## 2. Formal Economic Model Representation

### 2.1 Type System

The formal representation of economic models uses a typed system based on Lean 4's type theory:

```lean
-- Core economic value representation
structure EconomicValue where
  dimension: ValueDimension
  amount: ℝ
  timeline: List (Period × ℝ)
  probability: ℝ
  deriving Repr

-- Stakeholder representation
structure Stakeholder where
  id: String
  type: StakeholderType
  capabilities: ValueDimension → ℝ
  preferences: ValueDimension → ℝ
  risk_tolerance: ℝ
  deriving Repr

-- Deal structure representation
structure Deal where
  intent: Intent
  solution: Solution 
  stakeholders: List Stakeholder
  financing: FinancingStructure
  execution: ExecutionPlan
  deriving Repr

-- Value distribution mechanism
structure ValueDistribution where
  allocation: Stakeholder → (ValueDimension → ℝ)
  total_value: ℝ
  is_pareto_optimal: Prop
  is_win_win: Prop
  deriving Repr
```

### 2.2 Economic Axioms

The framework defines foundational axioms of economic theory that serve as the basis for verification:

```lean
-- Value conservation in closed economic systems
axiom value_conservation {d: Deal} {v: ℝ} : 
  total_created_value d = total_distributed_value d

-- Utility maximization behavior
axiom utility_maximization {s: Stakeholder} {u: ℝ → ℝ} {choices: Set Action} :
  stakeholder_choice s choices = argmax (λ a, u (stakeholder_value s a)) choices

-- Win-win condition
axiom win_win_condition {d: Deal} {s: List Stakeholder} :
  is_win_win d ↔ ∀ s ∈ stakeholders d, stakeholder_value s d > 0

-- Risk-reward relationship
axiom risk_reward_relationship {v: EconomicValue} {r: ℝ} :
  expected_value v = base_value v * probability v - risk_premium r
```

### 2.3 Formal Properties

Key properties of economic models that can be verified:

```lean
-- Pareto optimality
def is_pareto_optimal (d: Deal) : Prop :=
  ¬∃ d', (∀ s ∈ stakeholders d, stakeholder_value s d' ≥ stakeholder_value s d) ∧ 
         (∃ s ∈ stakeholders d, stakeholder_value s d' > stakeholder_value s d)

-- Fair value distribution
def is_fair_distribution (d: Deal) (fairness_criterion: FairnessCriterion) : Prop :=
  match fairness_criterion with
  | FairnessCriterion.equitable => 
      ∀ s₁ s₂ ∈ stakeholders d, 
        stakeholder_value s₁ d / stakeholder_contribution s₁ d =
        stakeholder_value s₂ d / stakeholder_contribution s₂ d
  | FairnessCriterion.proportional => 
      ∀ s ∈ stakeholders d, 
        stakeholder_value s d = stakeholder_contribution s d * total_value d / total_contribution d
  | FairnessCriterion.maximin => 
      ∀ d', min_stakeholder_value d ≥ min_stakeholder_value d'

-- Deal value optimization
def is_dvf_optimal (d: Deal) : Prop :=
  ¬∃ d', dealValueFunction d' > dealValueFunction d ∧ 
         satisfies_constraints d' (constraints d)

-- Risk-balanced distribution
def is_risk_balanced (d: Deal) : Prop :=
  ∀ s ∈ stakeholders d, 
    risk_exposure s d / risk_tolerance s = risk_exposure_ratio d
```

## 3. Verification Methodologies

### 3.1 Theorem Decomposition for Economic Properties

The framework uses recursive theorem decomposition to break down complex economic theorems into verifiable subgoals:

#### Example: Win-Win Verification

```
THEOREM: ∀ d: Deal, is_win_win d ↔ ∀ s ∈ stakeholders d, stakeholder_value s d > 0

DECOMPOSITION:
1. Define stakeholder_value for each stakeholder type (4 subgoals)
   1.1 Define government_value: Government → Deal → ℝ
   1.2 Define corporate_value: Corporate → Deal → ℝ
   1.3 Define ngo_value: NGO → Deal → ℝ
   1.4 Define civilian_value: Civilian → Deal → ℝ

2. Prove value transformation properties (4 subgoals)
   2.1 Prove economic_to_government_value preserves sign
   2.2 Prove economic_to_corporate_value preserves sign
   2.3 Prove economic_to_ngo_value preserves sign
   2.4 Prove economic_to_civilian_value preserves sign

3. Prove main theorem using subgoals
   3.1 Prove forward direction: is_win_win d → ∀ s, stakeholder_value s d > 0
   3.2 Prove reverse direction: (∀ s, stakeholder_value s d > 0) → is_win_win d
```

### 3.2 Proof Tactics for Economic Theorems

The framework defines specialized tactics for proving economic theorems:

```lean
-- Tactic for proving value distribution properties
tactic "value_distribution" => 
  repeat (apply value_conservation; simp [total_created_value, total_distributed_value])

-- Tactic for stakeholder value calculations
tactic "stakeholder_value" =>
  cases stakeholder_type;
  simp [government_value, corporate_value, ngo_value, civilian_value];
  repeat (apply value_transformation_lemma)

-- Tactic for win-win verification
tactic "verify_win_win" =>
  unfold is_win_win;
  apply win_win_condition;
  intros s s_in_stakeholders;
  stakeholder_value;
  linarith
```

### 3.3 Model Checking Approaches

The framework supports three complementary verification approaches:

1. **Deductive Verification**: Proving properties from axioms using the theorem prover
2. **Model Checking**: Exhaustively checking properties for bounded domains
3. **Quantitative Verification**: Reasoning about numerical properties within bounds

## 4. Economic Property Specification

### 4.1 Win-Win Properties

```lean
-- Basic win-win property
def basic_win_win (d: Deal) : Prop :=
  ∀ s ∈ stakeholders d, stakeholder_value s d > 0

-- Strong win-win (Pareto improvement)
def strong_win_win (d: Deal) (d₀: Deal) : Prop :=
  ∀ s ∈ stakeholders d, stakeholder_value s d > stakeholder_value s d₀

-- Buffett win-win (with margin of safety)
def buffett_win_win (d: Deal) (safety_margin: ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∀ s ∈ stakeholders d, stakeholder_value s d > safety_margin
```

### 4.2 Value Distribution Properties

```lean
-- Equitable distribution
def equitable_distribution (d: Deal) : Prop :=
  let values := List.map (λ s, stakeholder_value s d) (stakeholders d)
  let min_value := List.minimum values
  let max_value := List.maximum values
  max_value - min_value ≤ equity_threshold d

-- Proportional to contribution
def proportional_distribution (d: Deal) : Prop :=
  ∀ s ∈ stakeholders d,
    stakeholder_value s d / total_value d ≈ 
    stakeholder_contribution s d / total_contribution d

-- Nash bargaining solution
def nash_bargaining_solution (d: Deal) : Prop :=
  ∀ d', 
    (∀ s ∈ stakeholders d, stakeholder_value s d' ≥ 0) →
    product_of_values d ≥ product_of_values d'
  where
    product_of_values := λ d, List.prod (List.map (λ s, stakeholder_value s d) (stakeholders d))
```

### 4.3 Risk Properties

```lean
-- Risk balanced distribution
def risk_balanced (d: Deal) : Prop :=
  let risk_ratios := List.map (λ s, risk_exposure s d / risk_tolerance s) (stakeholders d)
  List.maximum risk_ratios - List.minimum risk_ratios ≤ risk_balance_threshold d

-- Black-Scholes risk property for deal options
def black_scholes_risk_property (d: Deal) (option: DealOption) : Prop :=
  option_value option = 
    black_scholes (underlying_value d) (strike_price option) (time_to_maturity option)
    (volatility d) (risk_free_rate d)
```

## 8. Implementation Strategy

### 8.1 Core Library Development

The framework requires development of several core libraries:

1. **Economic Type Library**: Formal definitions of economic concepts
2. **Theorem Library**: Common economic theorems and properties
3. **Tactics Library**: Specialized tactics for economic reasoning
4. **Integration Library**: Tools for HMS-A2A integration

### 8.2 Verification Strategy

The verification strategy follows a layered approach:

1. **Basic Property Verification**: Verify foundational properties (e.g., win-win)
2. **Structural Verification**: Verify structural properties of deals
3. **Optimality Verification**: Verify optimality properties
4. **Advanced Property Verification**: Verify complex economic properties

### 8.3 Framework Evolution

The framework will evolve through several stages:

1. **Foundation**: Basic economic types and axioms
2. **Extension**: Expanded theorem and tactics libraries
3. **Specialization**: Domain-specific extensions
4. **Integration**: Comprehensive HMS-A2A integration
5. **Automation**: Automated verification and optimization

This example demonstrates how the formal verification framework can identify issues in deal structures that might appear win-win based on simplified metrics but fail when formally verified.

## 10. Conclusion

The Economic Formal Verification Framework provides a rigorous foundation for verifying properties of economic models and deal structures. By adapting formal methods to the economic domain, it enables mathematical proof of critical properties like win-win conditions, fair value distribution, and optimality. Integration with the HMS-A2A ecosystem ensures that these formal verification capabilities enhance the economic modeling and deal optimization processes.

The framework is designed to evolve alongside the Economic Theorem Prover implementation, with each component supporting the overall goal of bringing formal verification to economic reasoning within the HMS ecosystem.
