## Integrated Verification Approach

The entire verification process will follow these principles:

1. **Continuous Verification**: Tests run automatically as part of CI/CD
2. **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Critical components verified first and most thoroughly
3. **Incremental Verification**: Each component verified individually before integration
4. **Traceability**: Requirements linked to verification tests
5. **Reporting**: Comprehensive verification reports for each component

This verification framework ensures that all components meet their functional and non-functional requirements, and that the integrated system works as intended under normal and adverse conditions.
