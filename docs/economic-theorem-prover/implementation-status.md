# Economic Theorem Prover - Implementation Status

This document tracks the implementation status of the Economic Theorem Prover with HMS integration, based on the UNIFIED-ECONOMIC-THEOREM-PROVER-HMS-PLAN.md and the ECONOMIC-THEOREM-PROVER-OPTIMIZATION-PLAN.md.

## Components Implemented

### HMS-Communication Package

The HMS-Communication package has been implemented with a focus on high-performance communication between Rust and Python components, following the optimization guidelines:

1. **Rust Components:**
   - `buffer.rs`: Zero-copy buffer implementation for efficient data transfer
   - `ffi.rs`: Optimized FFI bridge with shared memory regions and thread pools
   - `async_supervisor.rs`: Asynchronous supervisor for non-blocking operations
   - `memory.rs`: Memory-optimized data structures with specialized allocators
   - `metrics.rs`: Performance monitoring and metrics collection
   - `lib.rs`: Main library with error handling and module exports

2. **Python Components:**
   - `bridge.py`: Python bridge to the optimized FFI layer
   - `theorem_prover.py`: Interface to the Economic Theorem Prover
   - `setup.py`: Build script with Rust and Cython extensions
   - `example_theorem_prover.py`: Example usage of the theorem prover

### Key Optimization Features Implemented

1. **Zero-Copy Data Transfer:**
   - Shared memory regions for large data
