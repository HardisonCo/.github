# Economic Theorem Prover with Self-Healing Genetic Agents

This project implements an economic theorem proving system with self-healing genetic agents that optimize proof strategies.

## Components

- **HMS Supervisor**: Rust-based component that orchestrates the entire system
- **HMS AGT**: Agent core implementation for genetic algorithms
- **HMS FFI**: Foreign Function Interface for Rust-Python interoperability
- **Theorem Repository**: Manages economic theorems and their metadata
- **Proof Engine**: Processes theorem proving requests and generates proofs
- **Genetic Agents**: Self-evolving agents that optimize proof strategies
- **Self-Healing**: Monitors and recovers from system failures

## Development
