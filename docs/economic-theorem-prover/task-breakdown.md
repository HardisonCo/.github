## Resource Allocation and Critical Path

The critical path for this implementation runs through:
1. Advanced Genetic Algorithm Operators (WP1.1 → WP1.2 → WP1.3 → WP1.4 → WP1.5)
2. Economic-Specific Theorem Tactics (WP2.1 → WP2.2/WP2.3 → WP2.4 → WP2.5)
3. Integration Tests (WP3.1 → WP3.2 → WP3.3 → WP3.5)
4. Metrics and Documentation can be developed in parallel
5. Advanced Self-Healing Strategies depend on metrics completion

For optimal resource allocation, at least 3-4 developers with the following skills distribution are recommended:
- 1-2 developers focusing on genetic algorithms and theorem proving
- 1 developer focusing on integration testing and CI
- 1 developer focusing on metrics, visualization, and documentation
- 1 developer (possibly shared) focusing on self-healing strategies
