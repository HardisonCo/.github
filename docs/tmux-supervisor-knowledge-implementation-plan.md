## 10. Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow these guiding principles:

1. **Incremental Development**
   - Each component will be developed in small, testable increments
   - Regular integration tests will validate component interactions
   - Daily builds will ensure continuous progress

2. **Interface-First Design**
   - Clear interfaces will be defined before implementation
   - Mock implementations will enable parallel development
   - Interface contracts will ensure component compatibility

3. **Performance-Conscious Development**
   - Performance metrics will be collected from day one
   - Critical paths will be optimized early
   - Resource usage will be continuously monitored

4. **Documentation-Driven Development**
   - Interface documentation will precede implementation
   - Examples will be created alongside features
   - User guides will evolve with the implementation

## 11. Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of TMUX Integration core functionality
2. Set up continuous integration for all components
3. Create detailed technical specifications for Supervisor interfaces
4. Develop knowledge schema prototype
5. Begin implementation of visualization templates
