# HMS Knowledge Acquisition System

## Executive Overview

The HMS Knowledge Acquisition System (KAS) provides a standardized framework for agent knowledge acquisition, storage, retrieval, and update. It implements a five-pass knowledge acquisition approach that enables HMS agents to progressively build comprehensive understanding of their components, domains, and integration points.

This document defines the architecture, implementation, and usage of the HMS Knowledge Acquisition System across all HMS components, with specific focus on integration with HMS-A2A.

## Core Architecture

### Knowledge Acquisition Layers

The KAS implements five progressive knowledge acquisition layers:

1. **Structural Knowledge** - Basic component structure, files, and organization
2. **Functional Knowledge** - Primary functions, APIs, and capabilities 
3. **Domain Knowledge** - Domain-specific concepts and terminology
4. **Integration Knowledge** - Cross-component interaction patterns
5. **Historical Knowledge** - Previous decision patterns and outcomes

### Knowledge Manager Components

The KAS comprises the following components:

1. **KnowledgeAcquisitionManager** - Coordinates the knowledge acquisition process
2. **KnowledgeStorageManager** - Manages persistent storage of acquired knowledge
3. **KnowledgeRetrievalManager** - Facilitates efficient knowledge retrieval
4. **KnowledgeUpdateManager** - Handles updates to the knowledge base
5. **KnowledgeVerificationManager** - Ensures accuracy of acquired knowledge

## Implementation
