# Boot Sequence Architecture

## Overview

The Boot Sequence is a visualization and management system for Codex CLI initialization. It provides users with a clear, informative display of system components as they initialize, with status indicators, timing information, and error details. The architecture is designed to be consistent across both TypeScript and Rust implementations while leveraging the strengths of each language ecosystem.

## Core Concepts

### Component-Based Initialization

The boot sequence is built around a component model where each system component (e.g., API client, documentation system, etc.) is represented as a distinct entity with:

- Identity (ID and name)
- Description
- Status (waiting, initializing, ready, failed, or timed out)
- Dependencies on other components
- Performance metrics

This model allows for:
- Parallel initialization of independent components
- Dependency-aware ordering of component initialization
- Clear visualization of system status

### Progressive Disclosure

The boot sequence supports multiple display modes with increasing levels of detail:

1. **Minimal Mode**: Basic component status with minimal screen space
2. **Standard Mode**: Component status with timing information
3. **Detailed Mode**: Complete component details with dependencies and descriptions

This allows users to choose the level of detail based on their needs and terminal size.

### Accessibility

The architecture includes robust accessibility features:

1. **Text Mode**: Plain text output without terminal UI for screen readers
2. **High Contrast Mode**: Enhanced visual contrast for better readability
3. **Animation Disabling**: Option to disable animations for reduced visual stimuli

### Telemetry

Built-in telemetry collection provides insights into system performance:

1. **Component Timing**: Duration of each component's initialization
2. **Success Rate**: Tracking of successful vs. failed initializations
3. **Overall Performance**: Total boot sequence duration and statistics

## Architecture Components

### 1. Component Model

The foundation of the boot sequence is the component model, which defines the structure and behavior of system components.

#### BootComponent

Represents a single system component with properties:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the component
- `name`: Human-readable name
- `description`: Detailed description of component purpose
- `status`: Current initialization status (enum)
- `error`: Optional error message if initialization failed
- `durationMs`: Time taken to initialize (if completed)
- `dependencies`: List of component IDs this component depends on
- `children`: Nested sub-components

#### BootComponentStatus

Enum representing possible component states:

- `Waiting`: Not yet started
- `Initializing`: Currently initializing
- `Ready`: Successfully initialized
- `Failed`: Failed to initialize
- `TimedOut`: Initialization timed out

### 2. Configuration System

Controls the behavior and appearance of the boot sequence.

#### BootSequenceConfig

Configuration object with properties:

- `enabled`: Toggle boot sequence on/off
- `displayMode`: Visual presentation mode (minimal, standard, detailed)
- `accessibilityMode`: Accessibility mode (visual or text)
- `highContrast`: Toggle high contrast mode
- `disableAnimations`: Toggle animations
- `timeoutMs`: Component timeout in milliseconds
- `componentDelayMs`: Delay between component initializations
- `components`: List of component IDs to include

### 3. Dependency Management

Handles component dependencies and initialization order.

#### DependencyManager

Manages component dependencies with functionality:

- Topological sorting of components based on dependencies
- Circular dependency detection
- Dependency graph visualization
- Concurrent initialization of independent components

### 4. Status Checking

Handles component status verification and updates.

#### StatusChecker

Responsible for:

- Checking if a component is ready
- Handling initialization timeouts
- Error capturing and formatting
- Status propagation to dependent components

### 5. Telemetry Collection

Gathers and processes performance metrics.

#### TelemetryCollector

Collects metrics including:

- Component initialization times
- Success/failure rates
- Overall boot sequence performance
- System environment information

### 6. Visualization

Presents the boot sequence to the user.

#### BootSequenceRenderer

Renders the boot sequence with:

- Component status indicators (icons or text)
- Progress visualization (progress bar or percentage)
- Interactive controls (keyboard shortcuts)
- Responsive layout based on terminal dimensions

## Implementation Details

### TypeScript Implementation

The TypeScript implementation uses:

- **React/Ink**: For terminal UI rendering
- **EventEmitter**: For component status change events
- **Async/Await**: For non-blocking component initialization

Key files:
- `index.ts`: Main entry point
- `boot-component.tsx`: Component rendering
- `boot-sequence-renderer.tsx`: UI rendering
- `boot-status.ts`: Status management
- `boot-telemetry.ts`: Telemetry collection
- `dependency-manager.ts`: Dependency resolution

### Rust Implementation

The Rust implementation uses:

- **Ratatui**: For terminal UI rendering
- **Tokio**: For async component initialization
- **Serde**: For configuration serialization/deserialization

Key files:
- `lib.rs`: Main entry point
- `component.rs`: Component model
- `sequence.rs`: Boot sequence controller
- `status.rs`: Status management
- `telemetry.rs`: Telemetry collection

## Integration Strategy

To maintain consistency across implementations, the architecture follows these principles:

1. **Shared Data Model**: Identical component and configuration structures
2. **Feature Parity**: All features implemented in both languages
3. **Consistent UI**: Visual output matches between implementations
4. **Common Configuration**: Configuration options work identically
5. **Unified Documentation**: Single source of truth for documentation

## User Interaction Flow

1. **Configuration Loading**
   - Load user configuration from environment or config file
   - Fall back to defaults for any missing options

2. **Component Registration**
   - Register standard system components
   - Add any user-defined components
   - Validate dependencies

3. **Dependency Resolution**
   - Build dependency graph
   - Check for circular dependencies
   - Create topological ordering

4. **Initialization Phase**
   - Begin visualization (terminal UI or text mode)
   - Initialize components in dependency order
   - Update UI with progress

5. **Completion**
   - Display summary statistics
   - Collect and store telemetry
   - Clean up terminal state

## Error Handling

The architecture includes robust error handling:

1. **Component Failures**
   - Individual component failures don't halt the entire process
   - Clear error messages displayed in UI
   - Dependent components marked as failed

2. **Timeout Management**
   - Components that exceed timeout threshold marked as timed out
   - Timeout visualization in UI
   - Configuration option for timeout duration

3. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Fall back to text mode if terminal UI fails
   - Continue CLI initialization even if boot sequence visualization fails

## Extensibility

The architecture supports extensibility through:

1. **Custom Components**
   - API for defining custom components
   - Integration with user-defined initialization logic

2. **Pluggable Status Checkers**
   - Replace default status checking logic
   - Custom status verification for specific components

3. **Visualization Customization**
   - Theme customization through configuration
   - Custom icons and colors

## Performance Considerations

1. **Lazy Loading**
   - Boot sequence code loaded only when enabled
   - Minimal impact on startup time when disabled

2. **Parallelization**
   - Concurrent initialization of independent components
   - Efficient dependency tree traversal

3. **Memory Efficiency**
   - Minimal memory footprint during visualization
   - Cleanup of resources after completion

## Future Directions

1. **Web Visualization**
   - Export boot sequence visualization to web format
   - Interactive web-based exploration of boot process

2. **Enhanced Telemetry**
   - Historical performance comparison
   - System environment correlation

3. **Advanced Dependency Management**
   - Dynamic dependency resolution
   - Conditional dependencies

4. **Internationalization**
   - Support for multiple languages in UI
   - Right-to-left text support
