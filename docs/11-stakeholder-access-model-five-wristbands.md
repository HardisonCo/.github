> ‚ÄúMy screen still says *‚ÄòUnable to generate content from LLM‚Äô* but the logs

> Who was it, and were they even allowed?‚Äù  
> ‚Äî NSF Program Officer, morning stand-up

Chapters 1-10 solved the *plumbing*‚Äîkeys can be stored, rotated, approved,
broadcast, even patched into code automatically.  
What keeps the whole thing safe is **who may do each step**.  
Enter `_ref`‚Äôs **Stakeholder Access Model**‚Äîfive color-coded wristbands that
lock or unlock every API, button, and CLI command in HMS.

Without this model the very fix for our **system functionality** bug
(‚Äúmissing API keys‚Äù) would create a bigger one: anyone could upload a random key
or drain the budget. With wristbands in place, NSF gets the keys *and* keeps
control.

## 1. Motivation ‚Äî The ‚ÄúWho Pressed Upload?‚Äù Moment

Target flow, condensed:

1. Analyst (`Verified`) clicks **Generate Research Summary** ‚Üí system says *No key*.  
2. Security Engineer (`Admin`) uploads `openai_primary` key.  
3. Oversight Auditor (`Oversight`) later reviews the upload.  
4. Analysts may now generate summaries; public users still cannot.

Each step is just an HTTP call ‚ü∑ wristband check. No check ‚Üí **403** ‚Üí bug persists.

## 2. The Five Wristbands at a Glance

| Wristband  | Typical NSF Actors                        | Key Powers for Our Use Case               |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Public     | Anonymous site visitors                   | See docs **only** (`/status`, `/docs`)    |
| Registered | Interns, vendors testing sandbox          | Hit non-sensitive endpoints (`/status/ai`)|
| Verified   | NSF research staff, program officers      | Call LLM summary endpoint **once keys exist** |
| Admin      | Security engineers, DevOps maintainers    | Upload / rotate keys, manage quotas       |
| Oversight  | Inspector General, GAO auditors           | Read-only access to logs & keys metadata  |

Roles live as a simple string in every JWT: `role: "Verified"` etc.

---

## 3. How to Use the Wristbands (NSF-Focused Demo)

### 3.1 YAML Rule (Governance Layer)

```yaml
# governance/roles.yaml
roles:
  Public:      []
  Registered:  []
  Verified:    ["ai:invoke-summary"]
  Admin:       ["ai:invoke-summary", "ai:key:write"]
  Oversight:   ["ai:read-logs"]
```

### 3.2 One-Line Guard (Interface Layer, 9 lines)

```python
# interface/security.py
ORDER = ["Public","Registered","Verified","Admin","Oversight"]

def assert_role(user, need):
    """
    Blocks if user.role ranks below required 'need'.
    """
    if ORDER.index(user.role) < ORDER.index(need):
        raise PermissionError(f"{user.role} < {need}")
```

### 3.3 Example Endpoints (< 20 lines each)

```python
# interface/routes.py
@post("/ai/summary")
def generate(user, prompt):
    assert_role(user, "Verified")
    return llm.ask(prompt, user_id=user.id)

@post("/keys/upload")
def upload_key(user, provider, cipher):
    assert_role(user, "Admin")      # ONLY Admin uploads
    vault.put(provider, cipher)
    return {"status":"stored"}
```

Inputs & outputs speak directly to our bug:

* ‚úÖ Analysts (Verified) can ask the LLM **only after** an Admin uploads a key.  
* ‚ùå Anyone else is blocked with `403 PermissionError`.

## 4. Internal Flow During the Use Case

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Analyst as Verified User
    actor SecEng  as Admin User
    participant UI  as Interface
    participant API as Backend API
    participant GOV as Governance YAML
    participant VAULT as Secret Vault
    participant OIG  as Oversight User

    Analyst->>UI: POST /ai/summary
    UI->>API: assert_role(Verified?)          %% check 1
    API-->>UI: 403 "Missing key"

    SecEng->>UI: POST /keys/upload
    UI->>API: assert_role(Admin?)             %% check 2
    API->>VAULT: store key
    API-->>SecEng: {"status":"stored"}

    Analyst->>UI: retry /ai/summary
    UI->>API: assert_role(Verified?)          %% check 3
    API->>LLM: call GPT w/ key
    API-->>Analyst: 200 draft html

    OIG->>UI: GET /logs/key-events
    UI->>API: assert_role(Oversight?)         %% check 4
    API-->>OIG: audit CSV
```

Every arrow marked ‚Äúcheck‚Äù is one call to `assert_role()` using the wristbands.

## 5. Tiny Token Issuer (Management Layer, 14 lines)

```python
# management/issue_token.py
import jwt, yaml, datetime as dt

ROLES = yaml.safe_load(open("governance/roles.yaml"))["roles"]

def issue(user_id, role):
    assert role in ROLES, "Unknown wristband"
    claims = {
        "sub":  user_id,
        "role": role,
        "exp":  dt.datetime.utcnow() + dt.timedelta(hours=8)
    }
    return jwt.encode(claims, "hms-secret", algorithm="HS256")
```

Attach this JWT in the `Authorization: Bearer ‚Ä¶` header and every HMS component
knows the caller‚Äôs wristband.

## 6. Touch-Points with Other HMS Components

Component | How Wristbands Interact with It
----------|---------------------------------
[Human-in-the-Loop](02_human_in_the_loop_hitl_decision_maker_engagement_.md) | HITL UI shows or hides approval buttons based on `Admin` vs `Oversight`.
[Backend API (‚ÄúHeart‚Äù)](05_backend_api_heart_communication_hub_.md) | Stores the role claim alongside each `KeyActivated` event.
[Real-Time Sync](06_real_time_synchronization_event_broadcast_.md) | Bus tags every envelope with `role`; low roles can‚Äôt subscribe to high-risk channels.
[AI Governance Framework](09_ai_governance_framework_.md) | AIGF rules enforce that only `Verified` and above may trigger paid LLM calls.
[Zero-Trust Security Model](12_zero_trust_security_model_.md) | Uses the same role claim as an input to deeper network & token checks.

## 7. Analogy Corner üé°

Think of NSF‚Äôs HMS as a **science-fair venue**:

* Visitors (Public) wander halls.  
* Badge-holders (Registered) attend talks.  
* Speakers (Verified) access the podium.  
* Organisers (Admin) hold the master keys.  
* Judges (Oversight) can enter any room but may not touch exhibits.

Colored wristbands‚Äîfast, intuitive, and instantly visible.

---

## 8. Recap & Transition

The **Stakeholder Access Model** puts just enough fence around every action:

* Analysts can finally use the newly stored OpenAI key.  
* Only authorised staff can upload or rotate keys.  
* Auditors get read-only transparency‚Äîall enforced with a 9-line helper.

With roles nailed down we can harden the perimeter even further.  
Next, we extend these wristbands into a **Zero-Trust Security Model** that
validates *every* packet, even inside the firewall.
