## New Components

### Optimized Monte Carlo Simulation

The `optimized_monte_carlo.py` module implements a highly efficient Monte Carlo simulation for deal roadmap risk assessment:

```python
from optimized_monte_carlo import monte_carlo_roadmap_simulation_optimized

# Run 5000 simulations on a roadmap
results = monte_carlo_roadmap_simulation_optimized(roadmap, 5000)

print(f"Mean completion time: {results['mean_time']:.2f} Â± {results['std_time']:.2f}")
print(f"Mean total value: {results['mean_value']:.2f} Â± {results['std_value']:.2f}")
print(f"Mean ROI: {results['mean_roi']:.2f} Â± {results['std_roi']:.2f}")
```

Key features:
- Vectorized calculations using NumPy arrays for 20-50x speed improvement
- Parallel execution across multiple CPU cores
- Pre-generated random samples for efficiency
- Adaptive simulation count based on problem complexity
- Memory-efficient simulation data structures

### Performance Benchmarking

Use the `benchmark_monte_carlo.py` script to compare original and optimized implementations:

```bash
# Benchmark various roadmap sizes
python benchmark_monte_carlo.py --sizes small medium large --simulations 1000 --iterations 3 --plot performance_chart.png
```

The benchmarking system:
- Creates test roadmaps of configurable size and complexity
- Runs both original and optimized implementations
- Measures execution time, memory usage, and result accuracy
- Generates visual performance comparisons
- Exports detailed benchmark reports in JSON format
