# Integration of HMS-ACH with THE Platform

This document describes how the HMS-ACH (Automated Clearing House) module of the Hospital Management System (HMS) can be integrated into the THE platform to accelerate financial workflows, improve data visibility and support THE’s mission-driven goals.

---

## 1. Specific Capabilities of HMS-ACH Addressing THE’s Mission Needs

- **Automated Payment Processing**  
  • Real-time batching and submission of payer remittances via ACH and EFT.  
  • Support for ANSI X12 EDI 835 (Healthcare Claim Payment/Explanation of Benefits).  

- **Reconciliation & Exception Handling**  
  • Automatic matching of incoming payments against outstanding invoices/claims.  
  • Workflow-driven exception queues for unallocated funds or denied claims.  

- **Secure Fund Disbursement**  
  • Patient refund management (e.g., overpayments, deposit refunds).  
  • Vendor and supplier payments with configurable release rules.  

- **Compliance & Audit Trail**  
  • End-to-end audit logs (submission timestamps, transaction IDs).  
  • Built-in rules engine for ACH NACHA compliance and HIPAA privacy requirements.

- **Reporting & Analytics**  
  • Dashboards for days-sales-outstanding (DSO), payment cycle times, and denial rates.  
  • Exportable metrics for CFO reports and regulatory filings.

## 2. Technical Integration Architecture

### 2.1 APIs & Protocols
- **RESTful Endpoints (JSON)**  
  • `/api/v1/ach/payments` – initiate ACH batch  
  • `/api/v1/ach/status/{batchId}` – query batch/transaction status  
  • `/api/v1/ach/recon` – push reconciliation results

- **EDI X12 Interfaces**  
  • Outbound 835 generation and transmission via SFTP or AS2  
  • Inbound 820 (Payment Order/Remittance Advice) parsing

- **HL7 FHIR (Optional)**  
  • FHIR `PaymentNotice` resources for payers preferring FHIR-based workflows

### 2.2 Data Flows
1. **Claim Submission** (THE → HMS-ACH)  
   • THE’s billing engine calls `/ach/payments` with batch-level summary.  
2. **ACH Batch Creation** (HMS-ACH)  
   • System validates, generates EDI 820/CCD+ instructions, and routes to ACH operator.  
3. **Remittance Receipt** (HMS-ACH → THE)  
   • On 835 arrival, HMS-ACH parses and calls THE’s `/recon` endpoint with matched claim IDs.  
4. **Reconciliation Feedback** (THE)  
   • THE updates its A/R ledger, triggers alerts on exceptions.

### 2.3 Authentication & Security
- **OAuth 2.0 / JWT Tokens** for API calls  
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** for EDI SFTP/AS2 channels  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** within both systems  
- **Data Encryption** at-rest and in-transit (AES-256, TLS 1.2+)

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements for THE Stakeholders

- **Financial Efficiency**  
  • 30–50% reduction in manual reconciliation labor hours.  
  • 20% acceleration in cash‐flow realization (reduced DSO).

- **Error Reduction & Compliance**  
  • 90% fewer misapplied payments due to automated matching.  
  • Full audit trail reduces regulatory risk and penalties.

- **Operational Transparency**  
  • Real-time dashboards for CFOs, billing managers and compliance officers.  
  • Self-service reporting reduces ad-hoc data requests by 40%.

- **Patient & Vendor Satisfaction**  
  • Faster refunds and vendor payments—enhanced cash management.  
  • Clear remittance explanations reduce call-center inquiries.

## 4. Implementation Considerations Specific to THE

- **Data Mapping & Master Data**  
  • Align THE’s patient, insurance, and invoice identifiers with HMS-ACH’s schema.  
  • Establish a shared code set for service types, denial reasons, and payment adjustments.

- **Change Management**  
  • Training for billing teams on exception-handling workflows.  
  • Update standard operating procedures (SOPs) to reflect automated processes.

- **Scalability & Performance**  
  • Load-test API endpoints to handle peak billing cycles (e.g., month-end).  
  • Ensure high-availability deployment (active/active clusters).

- **Regulatory & Privacy Audits**  
  • Conduct joint penetration testing and HIPAA gap analysis.  
  • Maintain Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) where required.

## 5. Use Cases in Action

### 5.1 Use Case: Automated Insurance Remittance
1. **Trigger:** End of business day, THE compiles all paid claims.  
2. **Action:** THE invokes `/api/v1/ach/payments` with claim batch payload.  
3. **Outcome:**  
   • HMS-ACH sends the ACH file to the bank.  
   • Incoming 835 is parsed, matched, and reconciliation results are POSTed back.  
   • THE’s A/R ledger auto-updates, flagged exceptions are routed to billing staff.

### 5.2 Use Case: Patient Overpayment Refund
1. **Trigger:** Patient portal refund request logged in THE.  
2. **Action:** THE calls `/api/v1/ach/payments` specifying refund details.  
3. **Outcome:**  
   • HMS-ACH validates bank account details, schedules ACH credit.  
   • Refund status updates streamed back to THE for patient notification.

### 5.3 Use Case: Vendor Invoice Settlement
1. **Trigger:** Vendor invoices approved in THE’s procurement module.  
2. **Action:** THE sends invoice batch to HMS-ACH.  
3. **Outcome:**  
   • Payments executed via ACH; remittance advices returned.  
   • THE’s P2P ledger closes invoices automatically and notifies vendors.

By leveraging the HMS-ACH component, THE can streamline its end-to-end financial operations, achieve measurable reductions in processing times and errors, and strengthen compliance and reporting while delivering better service to patients and business partners.
