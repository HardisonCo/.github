  - Cash register module for on-site payments, refunds and voids  
- **Reconciliation & Ledger Posting**
  - Daily bank statement import and auto-match engine  
  - Integration with general ledger (GL) via configurable mapping tables  
- **Revenue Analytics & Reporting**
  - Dashboards for days-in-AR, cash forecasts, rate variance  
  - Ad-hoc and scheduled Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)-compliant reports  
- **Compliance & Audit Trail**
  - Role-based access controls, immutability of transaction logs  
  - SOC 2 and HIPAA-aligned data handling

## 2. Technical Integration Overview

1. **API Endpoints & Data Flows**  
   - RESTful APIs using JSON over HTTPS for:
     - Invoice creation (`POST /api/ach/invoices`)
     - Payment posting (`POST /api/ach/payments`)
     - Reconciliation uploads (`PUT /api/ach/bank-statements`)
     - GL batch export (`GET /api/ach/gl-batches`)  
   - Event-driven webhooks for real-time notifications:
     - `invoice.paid`, `payment.failed`, `reconciliation.matched`  

2. **Authentication & Security**  
   - OAuth 2.0 client-credentials grant for system-to-system calls  
   - Mutual TLS (mTLS) for high-sensitivity endpoints  
   - Encryption at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+)  

3. **Data Mapping & Transformation**  
   - Finance chart of accounts mapped via a configurable lookup table  
   - ISO-20022 XML or NACHA-formatted ACH files for external banking partners  
   - Customizable XSLT/JS transformations for legacy ERP ingestion  

4. **Integration Patterns**  
   - **Synchronous** for invoice/payment queries and acknowledgments  
   - **Batch** for end-of-day GL postings and bank statement reconciliations  
   - **Publish/Subscribe** for cross-module alerts (e.g., cash over-short, rate changes)

| Speed                   | Real-time posting of payments & receipts | Days-in-AR reduction from 45 to 30    |
| Efficiency              | FTE workload reduction                    | Cashiering headcount ↓ 25%            |
| Cash Flow Management    | Predictable daily cash forecasting       | Forecast variance < ±3%               |
| Compliance & Audit      | Centralized, immutable audit logs        | Audit cycle time ↓ 40%                |

## 4. Implementation Considerations for Finance

- **Data Governance & Security**  
  - Define data retention policies in line with financial regulations  
  - Encryption key management and role-based access reviews  

- **Chart of Accounts Alignment**  
  - Workshops to map existing COA codes to HMS-ACH categories  
  - Validation scripts to ensure one-to-one mappings  

- **Change Management & Training**  
  - Train finance staff on new workflows (e-invoicing, reconciliation tool)  
  - Develop quick-reference guides and host “office-hours” support  

- **Cutover & Parallel Run**  
  - Dual-entry period (2–4 weeks) comparing legacy system vs. HMS-ACH  
  - Reconciliation reports to validate completeness and accuracy  

- **Regulatory & Bank Certifications**  
  - Register ACH originator IDs and pre-notification processes  
  - Coordinate with banking partners on file layout and test cycles

## 5. Use Cases

### A. Real-Time Insurance Payment Posting
1. Patient visits and services rendered are coded in HMS clinical module.  
2. HMS-ACH invokes `POST /api/ach/invoices` to generate an e-remit invoice.  
3. The insurance company’s ERA (Electronic Remittance Advice) arrives via webhook.  
4. HMS-ACH auto-matches payment, posts to AR ledger, and notifies Finance dashboard.

### B. End-of-Day Bank Reconciliation
1. HMS-ACH pulls `GET /api/ach/bank-statements` with ISO-20022 payload.  
2. Auto-match engine aligns deposits/withdrawals to daily cashier logs.  
3. Unmatched items are flagged for Finance review in a “Discrepancy Report.”  
4. Upon approval, HMS-ACH generates a GL batch via `GET /api/ach/gl-batches`.

### C. Automated Patient Refund Workflow
1. Overpayment detected through patient portal or cashier catch.  
2. Finance triggers `POST /api/ach/payments` with negative amount and refund reason.  
3. HMS-ACH processes ACH refund and logs reversal entry to the general ledger.  
4. Automated email confirmation is sent to the patient.
