# Integration of HMS-ACH with the CONCILIATION Module

This document outlines how the Health Management System – Automated Clearing House component (HMS-ACH) can seamlessly integrate with and enhance the CONCILIATION (bank/financial reconciliation) capabilities in your environment.

---

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing CONCILIATION’s Mission

- **Automated Payment Generation**  
  - Create NACHA-compliant ACH files (CCD, CTX) or ISO20022 XML batches for payroll, vendor payables, patient refunds.  
  - Support for domestic and cross-border ACH formats and currency conversions.

- **Real-Time Transaction Status**  
  - Push/pull transaction status (pending, settled, returned) via APIs or webhooks.  
  - Immediate visibility into rejects, chargebacks, and exceptions.

- **Exception & Return Management**  
  - Automated identification of returned items (R02, R03, R29 codes).  
  - Built-in workflows for failed payment resolution, debit adjustments, and re-initiation.

- **Audit Trail & Reporting**  
  - Full time-stamped audit logs of every ACH file generation, transmission, and response.  
  - Pre-built reconciliation reports, drill-downs by payee, date range, and status.

- **Security & Compliance**  
  - SOC 2-certified data handling, end-to-end encryption (TLS 1.2+), and PII tokenization.  
  - NACHA operating rules compliance, OFAC screening, and KYC/AML checks.

## 2. Technical Integration Architecture

### 2.1 APIs & Data Flows
1. **Initiate Payment**  
   - CONCILIATION calls HMS-ACH REST endpoint `POST /payments/batch` with JSON payload:  
     ```json
     {
       "batchId": "BATCH-20240701",
       "entries": [ { "account": "123456", "amount": 100.00, "type": "CREDIT" }, … ]
     }
     ```
2. **Status Webhook / Polling**  
   - HMS-ACH sends webhook to `https://conciliation.example.com/hooks/ach-status` or CONCILIATION polls `GET /payments/batch/{batchId}/status`.
3. **Exception Callbacks**  
   - Returned items pushed via `POST /payments/returns` with NACHA return codes.
4. **File Exchange (Optional)**  
   - Secure SFTP drop/pick for NACHA or ISO20022 files, with MD5 checksums and PGP encryption.

### 2.2 Authentication & Security
- OAuth2 Client Credentials for API calls  
- Mutual TLS for file transfers  
- JWT for webhook payload signing  
- Role-based access control (RBAC) inside HMS-ACH

### 2.3 Data Mapping
- Field mapping between CONCILIATION’s ledger schema (e.g., `GL_ACC`, `TXN_DATE`) and HMS-ACH’s API model (`account`, `valueDate`).  
- Use of a shared master-data service for payee/vendor identifiers to ensure 1:1 matching.

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Stakeholder            | Pain Point                        | HMS-ACH + CONCILIATION Benefit        | KPI Improvement                |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Finance / Reconciliation Team | Manual matching of payments & bank statements | 90% of transactions auto-matched      | Reconciliation cycle ↓ 50%     |
| Treasury / Cash Mgmt   | Lack of real-time visibility      | Real-time settlement feeds            | Cash forecast accuracy ↑ 30%   |
| Audit / Compliance     | Audit gaps and missing trails     | End-to-end audit logs with timestamps | Audit findings ↓ 80%           |
| IT / Operations        | Multiple file-transfer processes  | Unified API + webhook mechanism       | Support tickets ↓ 40%          |

## 4. Implementation Considerations for CONCILIATION

- **Data Governance**  
  - Align on a common chart of accounts, payee master data, and ACH return codes.  
  - Establish SLAs for status updates and exception resolution.

- **Environment & Phasing**  
  - Sandbox integration for initial API testing.  
  - Pilot with a single payment type (e.g., vendor disbursements), then roll out payroll, refunds, etc.

- **Compliance & Risk**  
  - Validate NACHA rule adherence (duplicate entry checks, prenotification).  
  - Security assessments for SFTP endpoints, webhook URLs, and token lifecycles.

- **Training & Change Mgmt**  
  - Train finance teams on reading new reconciliation dashboards and exception workflows.  
  - Update SOPs to reflect automated steps and human-in-the-loop tasks.

## 5. Use Cases

### 5.1 Monthly Vendor Reconciliation
1. CONCILIATION compiles vendor payments for the month.  
2. Calls HMS-ACH API to generate ACH batch.  
3. HMS-ACH returns batch ID → store in CONCILIATION ledger.  
4. Upon settlement, HMS-ACH pushes “settled” status → CONCILIATION auto-marks matched.  
5. Returned entries generate exception tickets in CONCILIATION for review.

### 5.2 Patient Refund Processing
1. Trigger: Refund approved in patient billing system → writes to CONCILIATION.  
2. CONCILIATION invokes HMS-ACH to issue credit to patient’s bank account.  
3. Webhook notifies of ACH success/failure.  
4. CONCILIATION posts journal entries and updates patient account.

### 5.3 Real-Time Cash Forecasting
1. HMS-ACH streams intraday settlement events via Kafka to CONCILIATION’s cash dashboard.  
2. Treasury sees updated bank balance in real time.  
3. Automated alerts fire if net outflow exceeds thresholds.
