# Integration of HMS-ACH with ARTS

This document analyzes how the HMS-ACH (Health Management System – Aircraft/Component Health) module can integrate with and enhance the Advanced Radar Tracking System (ARTS). It covers key capabilities, technical architecture, stakeholder benefits, implementation considerations, and representative use cases.

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing ARTS Mission Needs

ARTS’s primary mission is to provide real-time radar surveillance, flight tracking, and controller decision support. HMS-ACH contributes:

- **Real-Time Health Telemetry**
  - Continuous streams of engine, avionics, and airframe health parameters (temperatures, pressures, vibration).
  - Status flags (OK, Watch, Warning, Critical) mapped to threshold breaches.
- **Predictive Diagnostics & Prognostics**
  - Machine-learning models forecast component Remaining Useful Life (RUL).
  - Early‐warning alerts for potential failures (e.g., hydraulic pump wear-out).
- **Event‐Driven Notification**
  - Automated Alarm Management: prioritized alerts routed to controllers and maintenance crews.
  - Correlation of health events with flight phases (taxi, climb, cruise, approach).
- **Historical Data & Trend Analysis**
  - Rolling archives of health logs for root‐cause analysis.
  - Dashboard KPIs: Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), on-time maintenance rate.
- **Standardized Data Interfaces**
  - Conforms to ARINC - 429/717 and A653 message sets.
  - Supports JSON, XML, and AFDX for modern data‐linking.

These capabilities align with ARTS’s need for:
- Proactive conflict resolution (e.g., reroute aircraft with degraded systems).
- Enhanced safety margins through early hazard detection.
- Operational efficiency by reducing unplanned ground stops.

## 2. Technical Integration Architecture

### 2.1 Overall Data Flow

1. **Onboard HMS-ACH** collects and preprocesses health data.
2. Data is pushed via a secure **ground data uplink** (satellite, VHF-Link, or wired gate‐side connection).
3. **ARTS Integration Layer** ingests, normalizes, and forwards to:
   - **Surveillance Display** (for controllers),
   - **Air Traffic Management (ATM) Workflow** engines,
   - **Maintenance Tracking System (MTS)**.

### 2.2 APIs and Protocols

- **RESTful APIs**  
  - Endpoints for health status (`/api/v1/health/status`), prognostics (`/api/v1/health/prognostic`), and historical logs (`/api/v1/health/history`).
  - Payload format: JSON (with optional XML support for legacy systems).
- **Message Queues / Streaming**  
  - Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ topics for high-frequency telemetry.
  - Topics: `hms.telemetry`, `hms.alerts`, `hms.prognostics`.
- **Data Standards**  
  - **ARINC 429/717** for legacy radar data correlation.
  - **ARINC 653** conformant partitioned messaging for safety‐critical links.

### 2.3 Authentication & Security

- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** for all point-to-point communication.
- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect** for API access tokens.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) tied into ARTS’s identity provider (IdP).
- Encryption at rest (FIPS 140-2) for all health logs.

## 3. Stakeholder Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Stakeholder        | Benefit                                           | Metrics/Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)               |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Air Traffic Control| Improved situational awareness of aircraft health | ↓ 30% emergency reroutes due to in-flight system faults |
| Airlines           | Fewer delays and cancellations                    | ↑ 15% on-time departures; ↓ 20% unscheduled ground time |
| Maintenance Teams  | Proactive tasking and resource planning           | ↓ 25% mean time to repair (MTTR); ↑ 40% scheduled maintenance accuracy |
| Safety Regulators  | Enhanced compliance visibility                    | 100% traceable health event logs; ↓ safety incident rate by 10% |
| IT / Ops           | Streamlined data integration and monitoring       | ↓ 50% manual data‐reconciliation effort                |

## 4. ARTS-Specific Implementation Considerations

- **Real-Time Determinism**  
  - Guarantee sub-second delivery of critical alerts to controller consoles.
  - Use of partitioned ARINC 653 channels for health‐critical traffic.
- **System Certification & Compliance**  
  - Adherence to DO-178C (software safety) and DO-297 (integrated modular avionics).
  - FISMA / FedRAMP requirements for cloud-hosted integration layers.
- **Legacy System Coexistence**  
  - Bridge between HMS-ACH’s modern REST/JSON and ARTS’s existing CORBA/IDL interfaces.
  - Phased deployment with backward‐compatible adapters.
- **Scalability & High Availability**  
  - Geo-redundant servers for N+1 failover.
  - Containerized microservices (Kubernetes) with auto-scaling.
- **Training & Change Management**  
  - Simulator drills for controllers to recognize and act on health alerts.
  - Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) updates and knowledge transfer workshops.

## 5. Use Cases

### 5.1 In-Flight Engine Anomaly Alert
1. HMS-ACH detects a rising turbine‐shaft vibration exceeding “Watch” threshold.
2. An immediate alert message publishes to `hms.alerts` with severity=“High”.
3. ARTS displays a health icon next to the flight strip, color-coded orange.
4. Controller consults onboard status, issues priority descent clearance.
5. Maintenance unit pre-stages replacement parts at destination.

### 5.2 Predictive Landing Gear Maintenance
1. HMS-ACH prognostics flags landing-gear actuator RUL < 50 flight-hours.
2. Data automatically shared via `/api/v1/health/prognostic`.
3. ARTS’s flow manager coordinates with Airline Operations Center (AOC).
4. Flight is rerouted to a hub airport with available maintenance slots.
5. Avoids unscheduled layover, reducing passenger disruption.

### 5.3 Post-Flight Health Trend Analysis
1. Daily batch of health logs ingested into ARTS’s historical datastore.
2. Trend-analysis dashboard highlights systems with rising “Watch” counts.
3. Operations analysts adjust maintenance planning for the fleet.
4. Over the month, unscheduled removals drop by 18%, optimizing spare usage.
