# Federal Maritime Commission (HMS-NFO Integration)

## Agency Overview

Regulates international ocean transportation, promoting fair competition and integrity in maritime commerce.

**Core Function:** Maritime commerce competitive framework

## First Principles Analysis

The FMC exists to foster competitive and non-discriminatory ocean transportation services in U.S. international trade. Its core function is preventing anticompetitive behavior in an industry characterized by high fixed costs and international jurisdictional complexity. The agency operates on the principle that maritime shipping requires specialized regulation due to its critical role in international commerce and unique operational characteristics. Its activities balance allowing necessary cooperation between carriers while preventing abuse of market power, recognizing that effective maritime regulation requires both industry expertise and vigilance against practices that could harm shippers or consumers.

### Fundamental Principles

- Oceanic shipping requires international coordination beyond national laws
- Container shipping operates as an oligopolistic market vulnerable to cartelization
- Port operations create natural monopoly conditions requiring oversight
- Global trade depends on reliable, fairly-priced ocean transportation

### Key Mechanisms

- Monitor carrier agreements for antitrust concerns
- License ocean transportation intermediaries
- Resolve shipping disputes between carriers and shippers
- Establish rules for detention and demurrage practices
