# HMS-ACH Integration with 

# Integration of HMS-ACH Component with COMMUNICATIONS

This document describes how the HMS-ACH (Ambulatory Care Hub) component of the Hospital Management System (HMS) can integrate with and benefit the COMMUNICATIONS domain. It covers the core capabilities, technical integration details, stakeholder benefits, implementation considerations, and concrete use‐case scenarios.

---

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing COMMUNICATIONS’ Mission Needs

1. **Real-Time Event Notification**  
   - Instant push or SMS alerts for critical care events (e.g., lab results, vital sign thresholds)  
   - Multi-channel routing: email, SMS, in-app, and paging

2. **Secure Messaging & Collaboration**  
   - Encrypted chat between care teams and COMMUNICATIONS dispatch  
   - Threaded conversations linked to specific patient records  

3. **Automated Appointment & Teleconference Scheduling**  
   - Outbound notifications for upcoming telehealth sessions  
   - Integration with video‐conferencing platforms (Zoom, Teams)

4. **Centralized Contact & Routing Logic**  
   - Role-based contact lists (on-call physicians, on-duty nurses, paging operators)  
   - Dynamic escalation chains on missed acknowledgments

5. **Audit Trail & Reporting**  
   - Time-stamped logs of all messages sent/received  
   - Dashboards showing delivery success rates, response times, and SLA compliance

## 2. Technical Integration

### 2.1 APIs & Data Flows  
- **RESTful Endpoints**  
  • `/api/notifications` – Accepts event payloads from COMMUNICATIONS (JSON)  
  • `/api/acknowledgments` – Receives delivery and user-read receipts  
  • `/api/users/{id}/contacts` – Retrieves role-based contact details  
- **Event Bus / Messaging**  
  • HMS-ACH publishes care-event messages onto an enterprise message broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ)  
  • COMMUNICATIONS subscribes to relevant topics (e.g., `lab_results`, `vital_alerts`)

### 2.2 Authentication & Authorization  
- **OAuth2.0 / OpenID Connect**  
  • COMMUNICATIONS services authenticate via a client‐credentials grant  
  • HMS-ACH issues scoped JWTs that encode roles and permitted channels  
- **mTLS / TLS Encryption**  
  • All API calls secured with TLS 1.2+  
  • Mutual TLS for service-to-service calls, ensuring both endpoints verify certificates

### 2.3 Data Mapping & Transformation  
- Incoming COMMUNICATIONS payloads are validated against HMS-ACH JSON schemas  
- A mapping layer transforms telephony or SMS status updates into HMS-ACH event acknowledgments

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

Stakeholder Group  | Benefit                                       | Metric / KPI
------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------
Care Team          | Faster alert delivery                         | 40% reduction in time-to-acknowledge  
COMMUNICATIONS Ops | Unified handling of all outbound channels     | Consolidation from 4 point-solutions to 1  
Patients           | Improved adherence to appointments & meds     | 25% drop in no-show rates  
IT / Compliance    | Centralized audit trail                       | 100% message traceability  

Additional gains:  
- **Reduction in Manual Overhead**: Automated routing cuts dispatcher workloads by ~30%.  
- **Higher SLA Compliance**: Integrated retry logic pushes successful delivery rates above 99.5%.

## 4. Implementation Considerations for COMMUNICATIONS

- **Regulatory & Privacy**  
  • Ensure HIPAA / GDPR compliance for patient data  
  • Role-based access controls prevent unauthorized message reads  
- **Network & Latency**  
  • Guarantee sub-second response times for critical alerts  
  • Prioritize VLAN or dedicated links for voice/SMS gateways  
- **High Availability & Disaster Recovery**  
  • Deploy HMS-ACH and COMMUNICATIONS connectors in active/active clusters  
  • Implement regional failover for the message broker  
- **Change Management & Training**  
  • On-site workshops for COMMUNICATIONS staff  
  • Simulation drills for critical-alert workflows  
- **Monitoring & Support**  
  • End-to-end observability (Prometheus/Grafana + centralized logs)  
  • Joint run-book between HMS and COMMUNICATIONS ops teams

## 5. Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Critical Lab Result Alert  
1. **Trigger**: Lab system posts a value outside normal range to HMS-ACH.  
2. **Flow**:  
   - HMS-ACH publishes a `lab_results` event.  
   - COMMUNICATIONS subscriber picks up the event.  
   - API call to `/api/notifications` with payload, specifying on-call path.  
   - Message dispatched via SMS & secure in-app chat.  
3. **Outcome**: On-call clinician acknowledges within 2 minutes; all steps logged.

### Use Case 2: Telehealth Session Reminder  
1. **Trigger**: 24-hour reminder job scheduled in HMS-ACH.  
2. **Flow**:  
   - Batch job collects tomorrow’s telehealth appointments.  
   - For each patient, calls COMMUNICATIONS’ SMS gateway.  
   - Confirms delivery status via `/api/acknowledgments`.  
3. **Outcome**: Patient receives URL and PIN; no-show rate drops by 18%.

### Use Case 3: Escalation on Missed Acknowledgment  
1. **Trigger**: Critical medication alert sent, no response in 5 minutes.  
2. **Flow**:  
   - HMS-ACH escalation engine routes to next level contact list.  
   - COMMUNICATIONS issues an automated phone call to senior nurse.  
3. **Outcome**: Escalation ensures timely intervention; supports audit for QA.
