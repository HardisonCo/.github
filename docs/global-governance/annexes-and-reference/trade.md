## 1. TRADE Mission Needs & Challenges

TRADE is a platform for planning, allocating, and executing transport and logistics missions. Key mission needs include:

- Real-time asset visibility (status, location, health)  
- Accurate forecasting of availability and maintenance windows  
- Automated tasking of transport assets based on readiness  
- Consolidated dashboards and alerts for operations staff  
- Scalability across distribution networks  

TRADE currently relies on periodic manual status updates from maintenance units, leading to reactive maintenance scheduling, unanticipated asset downtime, and sub-optimal route/task assignments.

## 2. HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing TRADE’s Needs

HMS-ACH is an advanced health management component that delivers:

- **Real-Time Condition Monitoring**  
  • In-field sensor ingestion (vibration, temperature, hydraulic systems)  
  • Automated anomaly detection and severity classification  

- **Prognostics & Health Analytics**  
  • Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation via machine-learning models  
  • Predictive alerts for parts replacement before failure  

- **Maintenance Planning & Scheduling**  
  • Optimized maintenance windows based on mission timelines  
  • Dynamic re-prioritization of tasks if health thresholds are exceeded  

- **Event-Driven Notifications**  
  • Push notifications via message bus when critical thresholds breach  
  • Integration with operator dashboards and mobile clients  

- **Historic Data & Reporting**  
  • Time-series storage of health telemetry  
  • Compliance and trend analysis  

These capabilities directly map to TRADE’s requirements for real-time asset health, predictive readiness forecasting, and automated tasking.

## 3. Technical Integration Architecture

### 3.1 System Overview

```
+------------+       +------------+       +------------+
|  Field     |       |  HMS-ACH   |       |   TRADE    |
|  Sensors   |───►   |  Server    |───►   |  Platform  |
+------------+  Telemetry & Events  +------------+
                              ▲
                              │
                          Message Bus
```

### 3.2 APIs & Data Flows

1. **Sensor → HMS-ACH**  
   - Protocols: MQTT or AMQP for telemetry; HTTPS/REST for batch uploads  
   - Payloads: JSON (schema: `AssetID`, `Timestamp`, `SensorType`, `Value`)  

2. **HMS-ACH → TRADE**  
   - RESTful API endpoints:  
     • `GET /api/v1/asset/{id}/health` → current status & RUL  
     • `POST /api/v1/events/health-alert` → critical alerts  
   - Message-Driven: JMS or Kafka topics for event subscriptions  
     • Topic: `health.alerts` → subscribe within TRADE for real-time triggers  

3. **TRADE → HMS-ACH (Optional)**  
   - POST mission plans or asset assignments to adjust prognostic models  
   - `POST /api/v1/asset/{id}/usage-profile`

### 3.3 Authentication & Security

- **OAuth 2.0** for REST APIs  
  • TRADE as an OAuth client obtains access tokens from HMS-ACH authorization server  
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** on message bus for inter-service encryption  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  • Define roles: `TRADE_ReadOnly`, `TRADE_Operator`, `TRADE_Admin`  

### 3.4 Data Schema Alignment

- Establish a common **Asset Registry**  
  • Unique `AssetID` across TRADE and HMS-ACH  
- Utilize **OpenConfiguration** or similar modeling for sensor message definitions

## 4. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Stakeholder             | Benefit                                        | KPI / Metric                            |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Operations Planners     | Automated assignment of healthiest assets      | ↓ Unscheduled downtime (%)              |
| Maintenance Managers    | Accurate scheduling & reduced labor waste      | ↓ Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)            |
| Fleet Commanders        | Higher mission readiness rates                 | ↑ Asset Availability Rate (%)           |
| Logistics Analysts      | Data-driven forecasting of future maintenance  | ↑ Forecast accuracy for maintenance     |
| Finance / Procurement   | Optimized parts inventory                      | ↓ Spare parts carrying cost (%)         |

Additional improvements:  
- 20–30% reduction in emergency maintenance calls  
- 15% increase in asset utilization  
- Improved compliance reporting with end-to-end audit trail

## 5. TRADE-Specific Implementation Considerations

- **Network Constraints**  
  • Leverage edge processing in austere environments to pre-filter sensor data  
  • Satellite link latency — implement store-and-forward patterns  

- **Legacy System Integration**  
  • Provide an ETL layer to sync existing maintenance logs with HMS-ACH’s historic database  

- **Security Classification**  
  • Ensure data at rest/encrypted meets TRADE’s classification level (e.g., DoD IL4)  

- **Scalability & High Availability**  
  • Deploy HMS-ACH microservices in container-orchestrated clusters (Kubernetes)  
  • Auto-scale message brokers and database read replicas  

- **Change Management & Training**  
  • Joint workshops for TRADE operators and maintenance personnel  
  • Phased rollout: pilot → regional → enterprise

## 6. Use Cases

### 6.1 Pre-Deployment Readiness Assessment
- **Process**:  
  1. TRADE queries `GET /asset/{id}/health` for all assets in a theatre.  
  2. HMS-ACH returns current status + RUL.  
  3. TRADE auto-generates a readiness report and flags assets with RUL < mission duration.  
- **Outcome**: Prioritized maintenance before deployment.

### 6.2 In-Mission Dynamic Tasking
- **Process**:  
  1. Field sensor breach triggers HMS-ACH event on `health.alerts`.  
  2. TRADE subscribes and receives push notification.  
  3. TRADE’s orchestration engine re-routes a healthier asset to the mission.  
- **Outcome**: Minimized mission delays; continuous mission support.

### 6.3 Post-Mission Analysis & Continuous Improvement
- **Process**:  
  1. After mission, TRADE sends asset usage profiles to HMS-ACH.  
  2. HMS-ACH refines prognostic models based on actual usage.  
  3. TRADE planners review “lessons learned” dashboards.  
- **Outcome**: Improved accuracy of future RUL predictions and maintenance cycles.

## 7. Conclusion

By integrating HMS-ACH’s advanced condition monitoring, prognostics, and event-driven alerts into the TRADE ecosystem, stakeholders gain real-time visibility of asset health, predictive readiness insights, and automated workflows that enhance mission effectiveness, reduce downtime, and optimize resource utilization. Implementing this integration involves standard REST/MQ messaging, robust security, and phased deployment tailored to TRADE’s operational environment.
