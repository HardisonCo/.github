# Integration of HMS-ACH with FOR

This document outlines how the HMS-ACH (Healthcare Management System – Acute Care Hospital) component can be integrated into the FOR (Fleet Operations & Readiness) environment. It covers specific capabilities, technical integration details, stakeholder benefits, implementation considerations, and illustrative use cases.

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing FOR’s Mission Needs

1. **Patient & Casualty Tracking**  
   - Real-time registry of admitted or evacuated casualties  
   - Geolocation tagging of field treatment sites  
   - Automated status updates (triage level, bed assignment, discharge)

2. **Resource & Bed Management**  
   - Dynamic bed-availability dashboard  
   - Automated resource allocation (ventilators, pharmaceuticals, PPE)  
   - Predictive load-balancing algorithms based on incoming casualty forecasts

3. **Clinical Documentation & EHR Integration**  
   - HL7 FHIR–compliant electronic health records  
   - Standardized clinical templates (trauma, surgery, ICU)  
   - Interoperable data exchange with theatre EMRs

4. **Medical Readiness & Reporting**  
   - Personnel qualification, immunization, and readiness status tracking  
   - Configurable dashboards for commanding officers  
   - Automated readiness and after-action reports

5. **Logistics & Supply Chain**  
   - Inventory management with automatic reorder thresholds  
   - Supply-chain event alerts (delays, shortages)  
   - Integration with FOR’s logistics management for consolidated forecasting

## 2. Technical Integration Overview

### 2.1 APIs & Data Flows  
- **RESTful API Endpoints**  
  - `GET /patients` → List current patients  
  - `POST /admissions` → Register new casualty  
  - `PATCH /bedstatus/{bedId}` → Update bed availability  
- **FHIR Resources**  
  - Patient, Encounter, Observation, MedicationRequest  
- **Message-Based Integration**  
  - HL7 v2 ADT feeds via secure MSP (Message Switching Platform)

### 2.2 Authentication & Authorization  
- **OAuth2.0 / OpenID Connect**  
  - HMS-ACH as resource server  
  - FOR’s Identity Provider issues JWT access tokens  
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)**  
  - Enforces certificate-based channel security  
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**  
  - Enforce least-privilege: e.g., medic, dispatcher, commander roles

### 2.3 Data Synchronization  
- **Event-Driven Architecture**  
  - Change Data Capture (CDC) for near-real-time updates  
  - Kafka (or JMS) topics for patient/admission events  
- **Batch Sync**  
  - Nightly ETL for archival and analytics in FOR’s Data Warehouse

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Stakeholder         | Benefit                                   | KPI / Metric                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Field Medics        | Instant access to patient history         | ↓ Time to decision (target: 15 mins)  |
| Hospital Commanders | Optimized bed and resource utilization    | ↑ Bed turnover rate (target: +10 %)    |
| Logistics Officers  | Proactive supply forecasting              | ↓ Stock-out incidents (target: −30 %)  |
| Senior Leadership   | Unified readiness & after-action reporting| ↓ Report prep time (target: −50 %)     |

- **Improved Situational Awareness**  
  Consolidated dashboards reduce information latency from hours to minutes.
- **Faster Casualty Throughput**  
  Automated triage-to-treatment workflows decrease wait times by 20–30 %.
- **Data-Driven Readiness**  
  Real-time readiness KPIs enable proactive force health protection.

## 4. Implementation Considerations Specific to FOR

- **Network Constraints**  
  - Support for intermittent connectivity (store-and-forward mode)  
  - Data compression for low-bandwidth environments
- **Security & Compliance**  
  - HIPAA / DoD 8320.02 alignment for PHI  
  - Regular penetration testing and continuous vulnerability scanning
- **Deployment Model**  
  - Hybrid cloud with on-premise edge nodes in deployed theaters  
  - Containerized microservices for rapid scaling
- **Training & Change Management**  
  - Role-based simulation drills  
  - Embedded “help” workflows and contextual guidance in the UI

## 5. Use Cases

### 5.1 Field Casualty Evacuation
1. **Event**: Mass-casualty incident occurs.  
2. **Workflow**:  
   - Field medic uses HMS-ACH mobile UI to register casualties.  
   - Data syncs via HL7 FHIR to FOR’s commander dashboard.  
   - Command center assigns evac routes based on real-time bed availability.  
3. **Outcome**: 25 % faster evacuation coordination, minimized diversion delays.

### 5.2 Surge Capacity Management
1. **Event**: Sudden influx of patients at a forward-deployed hospital.  
2. **Workflow**:  
   - HMS-ACH triggers predictive alerts when occupancy > 85 %.  
   - FOR logistics auto-issues supply orders and requests mutual aid.  
   - Temporary wards spun up; data flows to central analytics.  
3. **Outcome**: No critical resource depletion; smooth expansion of bed capacity.

### 5.3 Readiness Reporting & After-Action Review
1. **Event**: Completion of a joint exercise.  
2. **Workflow**:  
   - HMS-ACH aggregates med-readiness data (immunizations, certifications).  
   - FOR’s analytics ingests nightly batch for comprehensive readiness dashboards.  
   - Automated AAR report generated for leadership review.  
3. **Outcome**: 50 % reduction in report prep time; actionable insights captured immediately.

## 6. Next Steps & Recommendations

- **Pilot Deployment** in one forward-deployed hospital to validate data flows.  
- **Security Assessment** to finalize mTLS and OAuth scopes.  
- **Stakeholder Workshops** for process alignment and user-acceptance testing.  
- **Scale-Out Plan** to onboard additional field units and legacy systems over 6–12 months.
