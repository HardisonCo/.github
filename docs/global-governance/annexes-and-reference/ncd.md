# National Council on Disability (HMS-NFO Integration)

## Agency Overview

Advises the government on disability policies, employing advanced data analytics to promote inclusive practices nationwide.

**Core Function:** Disability perspective integration into governance

## First Principles Analysis

The NCD exists to ensure that disability perspectives are systematically incorporated into federal policy decisions. Its core function is providing independent assessment of how policies and programs affect people with disabilities across all domains of public life. The agency operates on the principle that disability is a natural part of human diversity requiring accommodation rather than exclusion. Its advisory role spans policy development, program evaluation, and legislative recommendations, recognizing that effective disability policy requires both specialized expertise and the lived experience of people with disabilities themselves.

### Fundamental Principles

- Policy design often overlooks disability impacts without dedicated advocacy
- Disability perspective requires representation in government decision-making
- Accessibility is a civil rights issue, not just a medical consideration
- Independent analysis provides necessary counterbalance to established practices

### Key Mechanisms

- Evaluate existing and proposed policies for disability impact
- Recommend legislative and regulatory approaches to eliminate barriers
- Gather data on disability community experiences and outcomes
- Advise executive branch and Congress on disability considerations
