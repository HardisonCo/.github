# HMS-ACH Integration with 

# Integration Analysis: HMS-ACH Component with the UNITED Platform

This document outlines how the Health Monitoring System – Aircraft/Asset Condition Health (HMS-ACH) component can integrate with and benefit the UNITED mission environment.

---

## 1. HMS-ACH Component Overview
HMS-ACH is a real-time health-monitoring and prognostics service for mission-critical assets. Its core capabilities:
- **Continuous Telemetry Ingestion**  
  Collects sensor, log, and performance data from distributed platforms.
- **Anomaly Detection & Prognostics**  
  Applies machine-learning models to detect deviations and predict impending failures.
- **Health-Status Dashboards**  
  Provides customizable UIs for condition visualization, trend analysis, and alerts.
- **Maintenance Work-Order Generation**  
  Automatically triggers maintenance workflows when thresholds are exceeded.
- **Historical Reporting & Analytics**  
  Stores long-term data for root-cause analysis and reliability metrics.

|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 24×7 asset readiness visibility    | Real-time dashboards with health-status indicators                    |
| Proactive failure prevention       | Predictive analytics and ML-driven prognostics                        |
| Rapid response to asset anomalies  | Automated alerts (email/SMS/OPS-TCP) and maintenance ticket creation  |
| Unified data source for decisions  | Consolidated telemetry ingestion and normalized data model           |
| Audit trail & compliance reporting | Historical logs and on-demand compliance reports                     |

## 3. Technical Integration Architecture

### 3.1 Data Flow & APIs
1. **Data Collection Agents**  
   - Deployed on edge platforms or gateways  
   - Stream telemetry via MQTT or gRPC to HMS-ACH ingestion endpoints
2. **HMS-ACH Ingestion API**  
   - RESTful endpoints (`POST /v1/telemetry`) accepting JSON or binary payloads  
   - WebSocket feeds for low-latency streams
3. **UNITED Data Broker**  
   - Pulls consolidated health events via a secure REST API (`GET /v1/hms-events`)  
   - Subscribes to HMS-ACH’s Kafka topics for real-time event streaming
4. **UNITED Dashboard & C2**  
   - Embeds HMS-ACH widget libraries (JavaScript/React) for asset cards and trend charts  
   - Orchestrates maintenance actions via UNITED’s workflow engine calling back into HMS-ACH’s Work Order API (`POST /v1/workorders`)

### 3.2 Authentication & Security
- **TLS 1.2+ everywhere**  
- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect** for REST API access tokens  
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** for high-assurance machine-to-machine communication  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
- **FIPS-compliant cryptographic modules** to meet classified network requirements

## 4. Stakeholder Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Stakeholder        | Benefit                                             | Metrics / KPIs                              |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Operations Center  | Unified view of asset health for faster decision-making | % reduction in mean time to detect (MTTD)   |
| Maintenance Teams  | Automated work-orders and prognostic alerts         | % decrease in unplanned maintenance events  |
| Program Managers   | Historical reliability and availability reports     | Increase in mission readiness percentage    |
| IT & Cybersecurity | Secure, auditable data flows                        | Zero security incidents from integrations   |

## 5. UNITED-Specific Implementation Considerations

- **Network Topology**  
  - Leverage existing UNITED data enclave for secure data transit  
  - Ensure air-gapped or cross-domain solutions if required  
- **Data Model Alignment**  
  - Map HMS-ACH asset/parameter schema to UNITED’s Common Information Model (CIM)  
  - Establish canonical event taxonomy for health anomalies  
- **Incremental Rollout**  
  - Phase 1: Proof-of-Concept with a subset of assets  
  - Phase 2: Broader fleet integration, refine ML thresholds  
  - Phase 3: Full operational acceptance and training  
- **Training & SOP Updates**  
  - Develop quick-start guides for operators  
  - Update standard operating procedures (SOPs) to include HMS-ACH workflows  
- **Regulatory & Compliance**  
  - Validate under relevant DoD/DoN STIGs or ITAR controls  
  - Data retention policies aligned with UNITED’s archival requirements

## 6. Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Real-Time Engine Health Monitoring
1. **Telemetry Ingestion**  
   - Engine vibration and temperature data streamed at 10 Hz to HMS-ACH  
2. **Anomaly Detection**  
   - ML detects trending vibration spike exceeding threshold  
3. **UNITED Dashboard Alert**  
   - Red banner on asset card in UNITED C2 with “Engine Vibe Alert”  
4. **Automated Work-Order**  
   - Maintenance ticket created in UNITED’s CMMS; tech notified via SMS  

### Use Case 2: Predictive Landing-Gear Maintenance
1. **Historical Analysis**  
   - HMS-ACH analyzes past cycle counts vs. wear indicators  
2. **Prognostic Notification**  
   - 48 hours prior to predicted threshold, HMS-ACH issues “Gear Inspection Due”  
3. **Mission Planner Integration**  
   - UNITED scheduler flags asset out-of-service window; reassigns backup asset  
4. **Post-Maintenance Verification**  
   - Inspection results fed back into HMS-ACH closing the loop

## 7. Conclusion
By integrating HMS-ACH with the UNITED platform via secure APIs, shared data models, and embedded dashboards, stakeholders gain proactive health visibility, faster decision cycles, and measurable readiness improvements. A phased, standards-based implementation will ensure smooth adoption and lasting mission impact.
