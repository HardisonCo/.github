  - Centralized alias registry (Common User Directory)  
  - Real-time presence and availability status  

- **Archiving & Audit Trails**  
  - Write-once, read-many (WORM) archival storage  
  - Tamper-evident logs for compliance reporting  

- **Scalability & Fault Tolerance**  
  - Distributed clustered servers  
  - Automatic failover and load balancing

## 2. Technical Integration Architecture

### 2.1 APIs and Data Flows

1. **Message Ingestion API (RESTful)**  
   - Endpoint: `https://hms-ach.example.gov/api/v1/messages`  
   - Payload: JSON (message body, metadata, classification label)  
2. **Presence & Directory API**  
   - Endpoint: `wss://hms-ach.example.gov/presence` (WebSocket)  
   - Bi-directional data: user status updates, lookups  
3. **Event Notification Hook**  
   - Callback URL on MEDIATION side: `/events/hms`  
   - Push model for delivery receipts, alerts  

### 2.2 Authentication & Authorization

- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)**  
  - Both HMS-ACH and MEDIATION present certificates issued by a common DoD PKI  
- **OAuth 2.0 / JWT**  
  - Client credentials grant for system-to-system tokens  
  - Claims include user identity, role, and clearance level  
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**  
  - Policies evaluate classification label, user role, mission assignment

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements for MEDIATION Stakeholders

| Benefit Area               | Metric / KPI                         | Before HMS-ACH          | After Integration                   |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Secure Collaboration**   | % of messages with approved encryption | ~60%                    | 100% encrypted & non-repudiable      |
| **Speed of Coordination**  | Message delivery latency             | 5–10 seconds            | <2 seconds (average)                 |
| **Audit & Compliance**     | Time to produce log reports          | 2–3 days                | < 2 hours                            |
| **Availability**           | Uptime (monthly)                     | 98.5%                   | ≥ 99.9%                              |
| **User Satisfaction**      | Internal survey score (1–5)          | 3.2                     | ≥ 4.5                                |

- Improved mission agility through real-time secure messaging  
- Greater transparency and trust among multi-agency mediation partners  
- Reduced administrative overhead for classification and archiving

## 4. Implementation Considerations Specific to MEDIATION

- **Network Boundary Crossing**  
  - Deploy dual‐homed guards at each enterprise perimeter  
  - Ensure MEDIATION’s DMZs are configured for SIP and REST ports  

- **Data Classification Policies**  
  - Align MEDIATION labels with HMS-ACH’s built-in ACLs  
  - Customize labeling workflows for specialized mediation case data  

- **User Onboarding & Training**  
  - Role-based training modules for secure messaging and digital signatures  
  - Table-top exercises simulating high-sensitivity mediation scenarios  

- **Legacy System Interoperability**  
  - Gateways for X.400 or proprietary message buses  
  - Deploy adapters to map legacy directory entries into HMS-ACH’s alias registry  

- **Scale & Performance Testing**  
  - Conduct load tests up to peak mediation traffic (e.g., 10K messages/min)  
  - Validate failover drills in a staging environment

## 5. Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Cross-Agency Crisis Mediation

1. A Department of State liaison initiates a secure voice message via HMS-ACH (SIP-T)  
2. Message is auto-classified as “SECRET//MEDIATION”  
3. Digital signature and timestamp appended  
4. Real-time notification posted to MEDIATION’s dashboard  
5. Archive entry created for audit; stakeholders receive confirmation receipts  

_Outcomes:_  
- Zero mis-classifications  
- Immediate situational awareness across all parties  

### Use Case 2: Evidence Document Exchange

1. Counsel uploads evidentiary PDF to MEDIATION portal  
2. Portal invokes HMS-ACH REST API to encrypt and forward to adjudicators  
3. Files classified “UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY”  
4. Recipients retrieve via HMS-ACH client; access governed by ABAC policies  
5. Full audit log generated automatically  

_Outcomes:_  
- Streamlined document handling  
- Verifiable chain of custody  

### Use Case 3: Real-Time Presence for Negotiators

1. Negotiator A sets status to “Available-Secure Chat” in MEDIATION UI  
2. HMS-ACH Presence API broadcasts to global alias registry  
3. Mediators B and C see A’s status change instantly  
4. One-click secure XMPP chat session established  

_Outcomes:_  
- Enhanced coordination  
- Reduced “phone tag” delays
