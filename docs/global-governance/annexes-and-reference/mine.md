# HMS-ACH Integration with 

# Integration of HMS-ACH with the MINE Platform

This document outlines how the HMS-ACH (Health & Mission Support – Automated Condition Hub) component can integrate with and benefit the MINE (Maritime Intelligence & Networked Environment) system. We cover:

1. Specific HMS-ACH capabilities aligned to MINE’s mission  
2. Technical integration approach (APIs, data flows, authentication)  
3. Benefits and measurable improvements for MINE stakeholders  
4. MINE-specific implementation considerations  
5. Concrete use-case scenarios

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing MINE’s Mission Needs

- **Real-Time Platform Health Monitoring**  
  • Continuous telemetry collection (engine status, fuel levels, hull stress)  
  • Anomaly detection with configurable alert thresholds  
- **Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM)**  
  • Predictive analytics to forecast part failures  
  • Maintenance workflow triggers and work-order generation  
- **Operational Mission Support**  
  • Integration of health data with mission planning (route changes based on engine load)  
  • Automated risk scoring (combining sea state, weather, platform readiness)  
- **Data Fusion & Visualization**  
  • Unified dashboards showing vessel status, mission progress, and health trends  
  • Role-based views for commanders, engineers, and intelligence analysts  

These capabilities directly support MINE’s goals of maximizing operational availability, reducing downtime risk, and improving situational awareness across the fleet.

## 2. Technical Integration

### 2.1 API Framework  
- **RESTful Endpoints** (JSON/HTTPS):  
  • `/v1/telemetry` – submit vessel sensor streams  
  • `/v1/alerts` – retrieve live health alerts  
  • `/v1/maintenance-orders` – push/pull work-order data  
- **Webhooks**:  
  • Configurable callbacks for real-time event notifications (e.g., engine overheat)  

### 2.2 Data Flows  
1. **Telemetry Ingestion**  
   Vessel sensors → HMS-ACH Edge Gateway → HMS-ACH Core (time-series DB)  
2. **Processing & Alerts**  
   Core → Analytics Engine → Alerts Queue → MINE via webhook or polling  
3. **Maintenance Commands**  
   MINE issues maintenance tasks → HMS-ACH via `/v1/maintenance-orders`  
4. **Dashboard Sync**  
   HMS-ACH publishes status snapshots → MINE GIS/OPORD interface  

### 2.3 Authentication & Security  
- **OAuth 2.0 / JWT Tokens** for service-to-service authentication  
- **mTLS** for component-level trust  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** within HMS-ACH, mirroring MINE’s user roles  
- **Cross-Domain Guard (XDG)** if data must traverse security enclaves

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements for MINE Stakeholders

- **Readiness & Availability**  
  • 25–40% reduction in unscheduled downtime via predictive CBM  
  • 30% faster decision cycles in mission planning through integrated health data  
- **Cost Savings**  
  • 15% lower maintenance costs by shifting from calendar to condition-based schedules  
  • 20% reduction in spare-parts inventory through accurate failure forecasting  
- **Operational Efficiency**  
  • Single pane of glass: 50% fewer tool-switches for operators and analysts  
  • Automated alerting cuts manual monitoring effort by up to 60%  
- **Risk Mitigation**  
  • Early warning alerts reduce at-sea emergency events by ~35%  
  • Enhanced situational awareness lowers mission abort rates  

Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), Mean Time to Repair (MTTR), and Mission Success Rate should be established pre- and post-integration.

## 4. MINE-Specific Implementation Considerations

- **Network Topology & Bandwidth**  
  • Edge gateways to pre-process data on board, minimizing satellite link usage  
- **Security Classification**  
  • Ensure HMS-ACH handles data at the required classification level (e.g., SECRET/NATO)  
  • Integrate with MINE’s enterprise IDM (Identity Management) and SIEM  
- **Scalability & Resilience**  
  • Deploy HMS-ACH in containerized clusters within MINE’s on-prem Kubernetes  
  • Use high-availability brokers (e.g., Kafka) for event streams  
- **Change Management & Training**  
  • Cross-functional workshops (Ops, Deck, Engineering)  
  • Phased rollout: pilot on 2–3 vessels, then fleet-wide deployment

## 5. Use Cases

### 5.1 Enroute Mission Diversion Due to Engine Overheat  
1. HMS-ACH detects sustained coolant‐temperature rise above threshold.  
2. Automated alert sent to MINE Ops Dashboard via webhook.  
3. Mission Planner triggers diversion workflow; updates mission plan in MINE.  
4. Onboard crew receives updated orders and emergency maintenance task.  

**Result:** Mission diverted safely with minimal crew workload and no engine damage.

### 5.2 Predictive Pump Failure & Spare-Parts Optimization  
1. Vibration sensors on hydraulic pump feed HMS-ACH analytics.  
2. Predicted bearing wear finishes in 72 hrs → HMS-ACH auto-generates maintenance order.  
3. Order is pulled into MINE’s logistics module; parts shipped to next port.  
4. Crew replaces pump during scheduled port call, avoiding unscheduled downtime.  

**Result:** Zero‐downtime maintenance; optimized parts flow; reduced logistics cost.

---

### 5.3 Holistic Mission Health Scorecard  
1. HMS-ACH aggregates engine, hull, and sensor health metrics.  
2. Composite “Platform Readiness Score” pushed hourly to MINE’s Command UI.  
3. Command staff prioritize asset allocation and mission tasking based on scores.  

**Result:** Data-driven asset management, improved mission success probability by ~20%.

By leveraging HMS-ACH’s automated health monitoring, predictive maintenance, and seamless data integration via secure APIs, the MINE platform will realize significant operational, financial, and safety gains—all while scaling to meet complex maritime mission demands.
