## 1‚ÄÇWhy Do We Need a ‚ÄúDigital Phonebook‚Äù?

Imagine the Department of Transportation (DOT) just pushed **v1.7** of its *Bridge-Inspection* microservice.  
Within minutes:

* the **AI Scheduling Agent** must call the new endpoint to plan next-day inspections,  
* the **Metrics Dashboard** must scrape fresh health stats,  
* older replicas (v1.6) must quietly vanish from all calls.

If a single consumer keeps dialing the *retired* service, wrong data‚Äîor outages‚Äîfollow.  
**Microservice Registry & Discovery** is the always-current **phonebook** that:

1. Lets every service **publish its address & version**.  
2. Answers the question **‚ÄúWho is healthy right now?‚Äù** in milliseconds.  
3. Makes sure callers **never hit stale or dead endpoints**.

Result: new code rolls out, traffic instantly finds it, and nobody edits config files at 3 a.m. üéâ

## 2‚ÄÇBig Ideas in Plain English

| Term | Think of it as‚Ä¶ | Why it matters |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| Service Record | Phonebook entry | Holds `name`, `URL`, `version`, `last_heartbeat` |
| Registry | Central phonebook | Stores all records in one place |
| Discovery Client | Auto-dialer | Asks the registry **‚ÄúGive me a healthy Bridge-Inspection‚Äù** |
| TTL (Time-to-Live) | Expiration date | If a service stops checking-in, its record auto-expires |
| Health Check | ‚ÄúAre you alive?‚Äù ping | Keeps false numbers out of the phonebook |

## 3‚ÄÇCore Use Case: AI Agent Finds the Right Bridge-Inspection Service

Step-by-step goal:  
*AI Agent* needs to call **/schedule** on the *Bridge-Inspection* API and must land on the **latest healthy version**.

We will:

1. Register *Bridge-Inspection v1.7* with a 20-line script.  
2. Query the registry from the AI Agent.  
3. Watch the registry auto-drop a dead instance.

### 3.1‚ÄÇRegistering a Service (Python ‚Äì 15 lines)

```python
# register.py
import requests, socket, os, json, time

REG = os.getenv("REGISTRY", "http://registry:8000")
SELF = {
  "name": "bridge-inspection",
  "version": "1.7.0",
  "url": f"http://{socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())}:9000",
  "ttl": 30        # seconds
}

while True:                         # send a heartbeat every 10 s
    requests.put(f"{REG}/services", json=SELF, timeout=2)
    time.sleep(10)
```

Beginner explanation  
‚Ä¢ Sends a `PUT /services` with the service‚Äôs details.  
‚Ä¢ `ttl` means ‚Äúdelete my record if no heartbeat arrives for 30 s.‚Äù  
‚Ä¢ A loop keeps the record fresh; kill the process and it silently disappears.

---

### 3.2‚ÄÇDiscovering a Service (AI Agent ‚Äì 12 lines)

```python
import requests, os

REG = os.getenv("REGISTRY", "http://registry:8000")

def lookup(name):
    r = requests.get(f"{REG}/services/{name}")
    # returns list sorted by newest, healthiest first
    svc = r.json()[0]                 # pick top record
    return svc["url"]

bridge_api = lookup("bridge-inspection")
resp = requests.post(f"{bridge_api}/schedule", json={"date":"2024-07-01"})
print(resp.status_code)               # 200 = success!
```

Explanation  
1. One `GET` fetches all healthy instances.  
2. Chooses the first (latest version, passing health checks).  
3. AI Agent never hard-codes hostnames‚Äîalways calls `lookup()` first.

---

### 3.3‚ÄÇWatch Auto-Cleanup (CLI ‚Äì 3 commands)

```bash
# 1. See record alive
curl http://registry:8000/services/bridge-inspection
# 2. Kill the service container
docker stop bridge-v1_7
# 3. Wait 30 s, query again ‚Äì record is gone!
curl http://registry:8000/services/bridge-inspection
```

The phonebook stays clean without human hands.

## 4‚ÄÇWhat Happens Under the Hood?

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SVC as Bridge-Inspection
    participant REG as Registry
    participant AG as AI Agent

    SVC->>REG: PUT /services  (heartbeat)
    loop every 10 s
        SVC->>REG: PUT /services
    end
    AG->>REG: GET /services/bridge-inspection
    REG-->>AG: JSON list (healthy, newest first)
    REG-->>REG: Auto-delete records after TTL
```

Four moving parts, all simple:

1. Service says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alive‚Äù every few seconds.  
2. Registry stores/refreshes the record.  
3. Callers ask ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs alive?‚Äù on demand.  
4. TTL sweeps remove stale entries.

## 5‚ÄÇPeek Inside the Registry (‚â§ 18 Lines)

```python
# registry.py  (tiny Flask app)
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import time, threading

app = Flask(__name__)
book = {}     # key -> record dict
lock = threading.Lock()

@app.put("/services")
def upsert():
    rec = request.json | {"last": time.time()}
    with lock:
        book[rec["name"], rec["url"]] = rec
    return "", 204

@app.get("/services/<name>")
def get_service(name):
    now = time.time()
    alive = [r for (n,_),r in book.items()
             if n == name and now - r["last"] < r["ttl"]]
    alive.sort(key=lambda r: (-r["last"], -float(r["version"].split(".")[1])))
    return jsonify(alive)
```

Explain the code line-by-line  
1. `book` is an in-memory dict: key is `(name,url)`.  
2. `upsert()` stores heartbeat with a timestamp.  
3. `get_service()` filters out expired records (`now - last > ttl`).  
4. Sorts newest heartbeat + highest minor version first.  
5. Returns JSON list; empty list means ‚Äúservice unavailable.‚Äù

*(Production registries like Consul, etcd, or Eureka add clustering & persistence, but the ideas stay identical.)*

## 6‚ÄÇRelationship to Other HMS-UTL Layers

‚Ä¢ **Service Mesh** ‚Äì Sidecars use the registry instead of static DNS when routing traffic. (See [Backend Services Mesh](09_backend_services_mesh__hms_svc__.md))  
‚Ä¢ **Governance Layer** ‚Äì Registry tags each record with the active `X-Policy-Version` coming from [Governance Layer](01_governance_layer__hms_gov__.md).  
‚Ä¢ **Metrics Dashboard** ‚Äì Health-check failures & TTL expirations feed live charts in [Metrics & Monitoring Dashboard](15_metrics___monitoring_dashboard_.md).  
‚Ä¢ **Continuous Delivery** ‚Äì New versions auto-appear during blue/green deploys, as you‚Äôll see in [Continuous Delivery & Compliance Pipeline](12_continuous_delivery___compliance_pipeline_.md).

## 7‚ÄÇFrequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if two versions are both healthy?**  
A: Registry sorts by *version* then by *freshness*. Callers can also request `?version=1.6.*` to target a specific line.

**Q: Do I need a load-balancer now?**  
A: No. The caller picks one healthy URL. Combined with the Service Mesh‚Äôs retries, this is usually enough. Large loads can still put a LB in front‚Äîregistry keeps it updated.

**Q: How are health checks defined?**  
A: Each service exposes `/health` (200 OK). Registry pings it every `health_interval` seconds; three failures mark the record unhealthy.

**Q: Does registry data survive a reboot?**  
A: In production, registry nodes store data in Raft-backed storage. Our toy code is RAM-only for clarity.

## 8‚ÄÇWhat You Learned

‚Ä¢ The Registry is a live phonebook: services add their number; callers look it up.  
‚Ä¢ Heartbeats + TTL keep the phonebook free of dead numbers.  
‚Ä¢ A 12-line caller and a 15-line registrar are enough to demo the pattern.  
‚Ä¢ Other HMS-UTL layers (mesh, governance, CI/CD, metrics) lean on the registry for fresh, trustworthy endpoints.
