# HMS-ACH Integration with 

# Integration of HMS-ACH with the SCIENCE System

This document outlines how the HMS-ACH (Access Control & Hub) component of the broader HMS platform can be integrated into the SCIENCE environment to strengthen data security, streamline workflows, and deliver measurable operational improvements.

## 1. Key HMS-ACH Capabilities for SCIENCE

- **Role- and Attribute-Based Access Control**  
  • Fine-grained entitlements (e.g., “Lab‐Technician,” “Principal Investigator,” “Data Curator”)  
  • Dynamic policies (time-of-day, project-phase, geo-fence)  
- **Centralized Identity Federation**  
  • SSO across SCIENCE portals, LIMS, and instrument consoles  
  • Supports SAML, OpenID Connect, LDAP/Active Directory  
- **Audit & Compliance Logging**  
  • Immutable audit trail of data access and policy changes  
  • Automated reporting for internal review or regulatory audits  
- **Secure Data Exchange Hub**  
  • Encrypted, message-oriented middleware for inter‐system telemetry  
  • Built-in schema validation (JSON Schema, Avro) to ensure data integrity  
- **Event-Driven Notifications**  
  • Real-time alerts on policy violations, anomalous access patterns, or data‐sharing requests  
  • Integration hooks for email, SMS, collaboration tools (e.g., Slack, Teams)

## 2. Technical Integration Overview

### 2.1 Authentication & Federation
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**  
  • SCIENCE users authenticate via SCIENCE IdP → HMS-ACH issues JWT access tokens  
- **SAML 2.0**  
  • For legacy LIMS or lab‐instrument UIs that rely on SAML assertions  
- **LDAP/Active Directory Sync**  
  • Periodic user/group sync to onboard/offboard personnel automatically  

### 2.2 API & Data Flows
- **RESTful APIs**  
  • `POST /policies` to define new access rules  
  • `GET /audit/logs?from=…&to=…` to query access events  
- **Message Bus (e.g., Kafka/RabbitMQ)**  
  • Lab instruments publish data → HMS-ACH validates schema & forwards to SCIENCE Data Lake  
  • SCIENCE analytics pipeline publishes alerts → HMS-ACH evaluates policy → notifies users  
- **HL7 FHIR (Optional)**  
  • If SCIENCE incorporates clinical data from onboard medical devices  

### 2.3 Security & Encryption
- **Transport**: TLS 1.2+  
- **At-Rest**: AES-256 on configuration, audit logs, and policy store  
- **Token Security**: Rotating JWT secrets, OAuth2 refresh tokens

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Benefit Area              | Metric / KPI                                | Expected Improvement                     |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Data Security             | Unauthorized access attempts                | –70% (blocked by fine-grained policies)  |
| Onboarding & Offboarding  | Time to provision or revoke access          | < 1 hour (from days/weeks previously)    |
| Audit & Compliance        | Time to prepare compliance report           | –80% (auto-generated logs & reports)     |
| Collaboration Efficiency  | Turnaround on data‐sharing requests         | –50% (policy automation vs. manual)      |
| Incident Response         | Mean time to detect unauthorized activity   | < 15 minutes (real-time alerting)        |

## 4. SCIENCE-Specific Implementation Considerations

1. **Bandwidth & Latency**  
   - SCIENCE’s remote field stations may have intermittent connectivity  
   - Deploy HMS-ACH edge-nodes to cache policies and queue audit events  
2. **Data Classification**  
   - Define custom sensitivity labels (e.g., “Exp-Alpha,” “Genomic,” “HazMat”)  
   - Map classification to access tiers in HMS-ACH  
3. **Regulatory Compliance**  
   - If SCIENCE handles personally identifiable information (PII) or health data, ensure alignment with GDPR/HIPAA  
   - Leverage HMS-ACH’s built-in compliance modules for record retention  
4. **Scalability**  
   - Plan for burst-mode ingestion when large experiments (e.g., high-throughput sequencing) come online  
   - Auto-scale the message bus and policy‐engine pods in Kubernetes  
5. **Change Management & Training**  
   - Early workshops for lab managers to model access workflows  
   - Documentation and sandbox environment for policy testing

## 5. Use Cases

### 5.1 Real-Time Instrument Data Sharing
- **Scenario**: A remote spectrometer at a polar research station generates gigabytes of spectral data.  
- **Flow**:  
  1. Device publishes to HMS-ACH message bus.  
  2. HMS-ACH validates schema & checks “Geography=Polar Station” policy.  
  3. Approved data forwarded to SCIENCE Data Lake; unauthorized attempts blocked/logged.  
  4. Alert sent to Principal Investigator’s Slack channel upon successful ingest.  

### 5.2 Controlled Access to Sensitive Genomic Data
- **Scenario**: A genomics dataset (labelled “High-Confidential”) must be shared only with approved researchers.  
- **Flow**:  
  1. Researcher attempts access via SCIENCE portal → redirected to HMS-ACH OIDC login.  
  2. HMS-ACH checks user’s group (“Genomics Team”), project affiliation, and time window.  
  3. Grant or deny access; log the decision.  
  4. For granted requests, generate a short-lived pre-signed URL for direct download.  

### 5.3 Compliance-Driven Audit Reporting
- **Scenario**: Quarterly audit of all data‐access events for a sensitive climate experiment.  
- **Flow**:  
  1. Auditor calls `GET /audit/logs` with date range & project filter.  
  2. HMS-ACH returns CSV/JSON of every access, along with policy versions in effect.  
  3. Automated summary report highlights anomalies (e.g., off-hours access).

By leveraging HMS-ACH’s robust access control, federation, and logging capabilities, the SCIENCE environment can achieve tighter security, faster collaboration, and streamlined compliance—all while maintaining the agility required for cutting-edge research.
