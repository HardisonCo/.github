## 2. Technical Integration Architecture

### 2.1 APIs and Data Flows
- **RESTful Endpoints**  
  • `GET /patients/{id}` → retrieve demographics  
  • `POST /claims` → submit ACH transactions  
  • `GET /payments/{batchId}` → query settlement status  
- **Event-Driven Messaging**  
  • JMS or Kafka topics for “ClaimCreated”, “PaymentSettled”, “ExceptionDetected”  
  • Business rules engine subscribes to transaction events  

### 2.2 Authentication & Security
- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect** for user and service authentication  
- **TLS 1.2+** for all in-transit encryption  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  • Billing clerks: view/resolve exceptions  
  • Finance managers: generate compliance reports  
- **Data at Rest Encryption** via AES-256 on financial records  

### 2.3 System Topology
- **HMS-ACH Microservice** deployed in [BUSINESS]’s private cloud/VPC  
- **API Gateway** applying rate limits and request validation  
- **Message Broker** (Kafka/RabbitMQ) routing ACH-related events

## 5. Use Cases

### 5.1 Automated Patient Billing Cycle
1. Patient discharge triggers `ClaimCreated` event in HMS.  
2. HMS-ACH ingests event, formats NACHA payment file, and submits to banking partner.  
3. Upon settlement, `PaymentSettled` event updates patient account and closes invoice.

### 5.2 Exception Workflow for Underpayments
1. HMS-ACH processes incoming 835 EDI remittance advice.  
2. Rules engine flags if payment < expected by >5%.  
3. Exception ticket roams to billing team via integrated help-desk for resolution.

### 5.3 Real-Time Financial Dashboard
1. Executive logs into HMS portal.  
2. API calls `GET /payments/summary` and `GET /aging-report` to populate charts.  
3. Drill-down reveals top 5 payers by aging, enabling proactive outreach.
