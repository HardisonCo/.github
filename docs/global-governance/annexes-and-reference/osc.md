# Office of Special Counsel (HMS-NFO Integration)

## Agency Overview

Investigates whistleblower disclosures and protects federal employees from prohibited personnel practices.

**Core Function:** Civil servant protection and information channel

## First Principles Analysis

The OSC exists to safeguard the merit system by protecting employees who disclose wrongdoing from retaliation. Its fundamental purpose is ensuring that federal employees can report violations without fear, thereby enhancing government integrity and effectiveness. The agency operates on the principle that whistleblower protection serves both employee rights and the public interest in accountable governance. Its functions include investigating prohibited personnel practices and protecting whistleblowers, recognizing that effective merit system protection requires both individual remedy for those who face retaliation and systemic deterrence against violations.

- Government effectiveness requires channels for internal correction

### Key Mechanisms
