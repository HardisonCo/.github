# HMS-ACH Integration with 

# Integration of HMS-ACH Component with the ELECTION System

This document outlines how the HMS-ACH (Automated Cryptography & Compliance Hub) component of the HMS platform can be integrated into an electronic election (ELECTION) system. It covers HMS-ACH specific capabilities, technical integration patterns, stakeholder benefits, implementation considerations, and concrete use-case scenarios.

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing ELECTION Mission Needs

- **FIPS-140-2-Validated Cryptography**  
  – Symmetric (AES-GCM, AES-CBC) and asymmetric (RSA, ECC) primitives  
  – Hardware-backed random number generation  
- **Key Lifecycle Management**  
  – Secure key generation, rotation, archival, and destruction  
  – Role-based separation of duties via dual-control and key-ceremony workflows  
- **Digital Signing & Verification**  
  – Ballot package signing (XML/JSON)  
  – Tally-sheet and result set signing with time-stamped audit  
- **Encryption/Decryption Services**  
  – At-rest encryption of vote repositories  
  – In-transit encryption for ballot delivery to polling devices  
- **Tamper-Evident Audit Logging**  
  – Immutable ledger of all cryptographic operations  
  – Secure log export in standard formats (e.g., JSON, CSV) for compliance audits  
- **High Availability & Disaster Recovery**  
  – Active-active HSM clustering  
  – Secure backup and geographically distributed key escrow

## 2. Technical Integration Overview

### 2.1 APIs & Protocols  
- **PKCS#11 Interface**  
  – Direct calls for signing, key operations, and random number generation  
- **RESTful Management API (HTTPS/JSON)**  
  – `/keys`, `/sign`, `/encrypt`, `/audit/logs` endpoints  
  – Swagger/OpenAPI definitions for easy client generation  
- **gRPC (Optional High-Throughput Mode)**  
  – Bidirectional streaming for bulk encryption or log replication  

### 2.2 Data Flows  
1. **Ballot Creation**  
   - ELECTION back-end packages ballots → calls `/sign` API → receives digital signature  
   - Signed ballots distributed to polling stations  
2. **Vote Casting**  
   - Polling device encrypts vote payload locally (public key)  
   - Encrypted payload sent to ELECTION tally service  
3. **Tallying & Result Signing**  
   - Tally engine computes totals → calls `/sign` → stores signed result  
4. **Audit & Reporting**  
   - Scheduled `/audit/logs` pulls for compliance team and external auditors  

### 2.3 Authentication & Authorization  
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)**  
  – Ensures only authorized ELECTION servers can call HMS-ACH  
- **OAuth 2.0 / JWT**  
  – Access tokens scoped per service (e.g., `sign:ballot`, `read:logs`)  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  – Admin vs. Operator vs. Auditor roles for API endpoints

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Stakeholder     | Pain Point Addressed                   | Measurable Improvement                   |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Election Board  | Risk of tampering & audit disputes     | 100% of ballots signed; 0 cryptographic breaches in pilot |
| IT Operations   | Complexity of cryptographic operations | 80% fewer manual key-ceremonies; 50% reduction in deployment time |
| Auditors        | Traceability of all crypto events      | Real-time immutable logs; 30% faster audit turnaround |
| Voter/Public    | Confidence in vote integrity           | Independent verification app trust score +15% |

- **Integrity & Non-Repudiation**  
  – All ballots and results carry verifiable digital signatures  
- **Process Efficiency**  
  – Automated key rotation schedules reduce human error  
- **Compliance & Transparency**  
  – Built-in audit trails satisfy standards (NIST, ISO 27001)

## 4. Implementation Considerations for ELECTION

- **Regulatory Compliance**  
  – Ensure HMS-ACH operates under applicable election laws (e.g., chain-of-custody rules)  
  – Formal key-ceremony protocols with bipartisan oversight  
- **Network Segmentation**  
  – Place HSM cluster in a secured zone; restrict access via firewalls/VPN  
- **High-Availability Architecture**  
  – N+1 HSM nodes across two data centers with automatic failover  
- **Disaster Recovery & Backup**  
  – Encrypted key-backup to offline vault; periodic restore drills  
- **Performance Tuning**  
  – Pre-warm HSM cache for peak voting windows; monitor latency for sign/encrypt ops  
- **Operator Training**  
  – Hands-on HSM key-ceremony exercises and incident response drills

## 5. Use Cases in Action

### 5.1 Ballot Generation & Signing  
1. ELECTION admin submits ballot definition JSON →  
2. HMS-ACH `/keys/generate` produces a ballot-signing key.  
3. Backend invokes `/sign?key=ballot` → obtains signed ballots.  
4. Signed ballots are pushed to polling stations via CDN.

### 5.2 Secure Vote Transmission  
1. Polling device fetches election public key from HMS-ACH `/keys/pub?key=tally`  
2. Device encrypts each vote → transmits to central tally service.  
3. Central service decrypts via HMS-ACH `/decrypt` under secure roles.

### 5.3 Tally & Result Certification  
1. After vote aggregation, ELECTION calls `/sign?key=result` for final tally  
2. HMS-ACH records the operation in its audit ledger  
3. Signed results published to public portal; independent observers verify signature.

### 5.4 Real-Time Audit Queries  
1. Auditor portal authenticates via OAuth2 → polls `/audit/logs?since=…`  
2. Retrieves tamper-evident logs for all crypto operations during election day  
3. Generates compliance report in under 1 hour (versus days in legacy setups)

By leveraging the HMS-ACH component, the ELECTION system gains a hardened, auditable, and highly available cryptographic foundation that bolsters integrity, streamlines operations, and delivers measurable stakeholder value.
