# Integration of the HMS-ACH Component with SPACE

This document analyzes how the HMS-ACH (Admission/Discharge/Transfer) module of the Hospital Management System (HMS) can integrate with and strengthen the SPACE mission support environment. We cover:

1. Specific HMS-ACH capabilities that address SPACE’s mission needs  
2. Technical integration (APIs, data flows, authentication)  
3. Stakeholder benefits and measurable improvements  
4. Implementation considerations unique to SPACE  
5. Concrete use cases demonstrating end-to-end integration

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Aligned to SPACE Mission Needs

- **Real-Time Patient Status Tracking**  
  • Immediate ADT (Admission/Discharge/Transfer) event generation  
  • Crew manifest updates as patients move between modules or return to Earth  
- **Bed & Resource Management**  
  • Dynamic bed-occupancy dashboard for on-station infirmaries  
  • Automated reservation of isolation/quarantine modules  
- **Automated Notifications & Alerting**  
  • Push-notification to medical leads upon critical transfers  
  • Auto-trigger of telemedicine consoles for remote consults  
- **Audit & Compliance Reporting**  
  • Time-stamped event logs for regulatory (e.g., FAA, international space health) audits  
  • Customizable reports (turnaround times, bed-utilization, resource gaps)  
- **Analytics & Forecasting**  
  • Historical ADT analytics to predict resource bottlenecks  
  • “What-if” simulations (e.g., mass-casualty on lunar base)

## 2. Technical Integration Overview

### 2.1 APIs & Interfaces
- **FHIR-compliant RESTful Endpoints**  
  • `/Patient/ADT` for event ingestion (Admission, Discharge, Transfer)  
  • `/Location` to query/update module/ward availability  
  • `/Notification` for event-driven webhooks  
- **WebSocket/Message Bus**  
  • Low-latency channel for critical ADT messages within the spacecraft LAN  
  • Fallback to MQTT with QoS guarantees for intermittent links  
- **Batch Data Exchange**  
  • HL7 v2.x flat-file exports over SFTP for archival or deep analytics  

### 2.2 Data Flows
1. **Admission**  
   - Medical officer initiates ADT via SPACE medical console → REST POST to HMS-ACH → HMS updates central EHR + bed dashboard → webhook notifies telemedicine team.  
2. **Transfer**  
   - Automated sensor data (e.g., vital signs crossing threshold) triggers transfer request → HMS-ACH reserves target location → status update published on message bus → crew transport module receives pick-up clearance.  
3. **Discharge**  
   - Discharge order from flight surgeon → HMS-ACH deactivates bed → system generates after-care tasks (telehealth follow-up) and exports summary to ground control.  

### 2.3 Security & Authentication
- **OAuth 2.0 with JWT**  
  • Token scopes: `adt:write`, `location:read`, `notification:subscribe`  
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** for spacecraft-to-ground links  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  • Defined roles: Medical Officer, Flight Surgeon, Telemedicine Specialist, Systems Admin  
- **Data Encryption**  
  • At-rest via AES-256  
  • In-transit via TLS 1.3

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Stakeholder        | Benefit                                   | Metric / KPI                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Flight Surgeons    | Faster decision cycle on transfers        | ↓ Decision latency by 40%                     |
| Medical Crew       | Reduced manual data entry                 | ↓ ADT clerical workload by 60%                |
| Operations Center  | End-to-end visibility of patient flows    | Real-time dashboard uptime ≥ 99.5%            |
| Safety & Compliance| Full audit trails and regulatory readiness| 100% of ADT events logged with timestamp      |
| Logistics & Supply | Forecasted bed & resource shortages       | Predictive accuracy > 85% for next-week needs |

- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated bed updates reduce manual reconciliation by hours per week.  
- **Risk Mitigation**: Early alerts on critical transfers ensure readiness of life‐support systems.  
- **Cost Savings**: Optimized resource use on long-duration missions (e.g., lunar, Mars transit).

## 4. Implementation Considerations for SPACE

1. **Network Reliability & Latency**  
   - Design for intermittent connectivity (store-and-forward, data caching).  
   - Prioritize WebSocket for local LAN; batch sync to ground during comm windows.
2. **Scalability & Partitioning**  
   - Namespace separation per habitat module (e.g., ISS, Gateway, Lunar Outpost).  
   - Horizontal scaling via Kubernetes if deployed on private cloud.
3. **Compliance & Data Sovereignty**  
   - Adhere to NASA/ESA health data guidelines and any participating‐nation regulations.  
   - Data segmentation: keep crew-medical PII on-station, send anonymized summaries to Earth.
4. **User Training & Change Management**  
   - On-station dry-runs during analog-mission training.  
   - Quick-reference guides for crew, remote support SOPs for ground med‐ops.
5. **Disaster Recovery & Failover**  
   - Cold-standby mirror on ground; prioritized ADT replay upon reconnection.  
   - Automated failover drill every quarter.

## 5. Use Cases

### 5.1 Medical Evacuation Prep
- **Scenario**: Crew member exhibits severe decompression sickness.  
- **Flow**:  
  1. On-station clinician logs “ADT-Transfer” to Medical Bay using HMS-ACH UI.  
  2. HMS-ACH reserves hyperbaric module and alerts telemedicine specialists via webhook.  
  3. Ground med-ops review vitals in real time; authorize evacuation trajectory.  

### 5.2 Cross-Module Discharge & Telehealth Follow-up
- **Scenario**: Crew member recovering from minor radiation exposure.  
- **Flow**:  
  1. Flight surgeon issues Discharge in HMS-ACH.  
  2. System unblocks bed in Infirmary A, creates telehealth task in TeleMed console.  
  3. Automatic summary sent via secure channel to Earth-based EHR for longitudinal tracking.

### 5.3 Surge Capacity Simulation
- **Scenario**: Analog base simulation of mass-casualty event.  
- **Flow**:  
  1. Simulation tool fires 20 simultaneous “Admission” events via HMS-ACH API.  
  2. Bed dashboard signals shortage; predictive analytics suggests re‐purposing adjacent module.  
  3. Ops team approves module-reassignment; HMS-ACH reconfigures location inventory in seconds.

# Conclusion
Integrating HMS-ACH into the SPACE environment yields real-time patient flow control, automates critical alerts, and provides robust analytics to meet the unique demands of space missions. The modular API-first approach, combined with secure authentication and resilient data flows, ensures that both on-station medical crew and ground support can operate with synchronized, up-to-date information—ultimately enhancing crew health, operational efficiency, and mission success.
