# Chapter 5: External System Adapter / Sync Bridge
*[Jump back to Chapter 4: Microservices Mesh & Service Registry](04_microservices_mesh___service_registry_.md)*

## 1. Why Do We Need a ‚ÄúSync Bridge‚Äù?

Inside HMS-AGX, every micro-service speaks the same modern language‚Äî**JSON over an mTLS mesh**.  
The real world, however, is full of *other* systems:

* a 1980s **mainframe** that prints checks,
* a county **SCADA** server that opens flood-gates,
* a commercial **HR SaaS** that tracks vacation days.

If any of these get out-of-sync with HMS policies, citizens suffer:  
Imagine the **U.S. Army Corps of Engineers** updates a *flood-control* schedule at 14:03, but the river-gate PLC still thinks it should open at 15:00. üåä

The **External System Adapter (a.k.a. Sync Bridge)** is the diplomatic envoy that keeps HMS and outside systems in *near real-time lock-step*‚Äîno matter how old, odd, or proprietary the neighbor may be.

## 2. Key Concepts (Plain-English Cheat-Sheet)

| Term                | Friendly Analogy |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Adapter             | A language interpreter between two diplomats. |
| Mapping File        | A pocket dictionary: ‚ÄúHMS `scheduleId` ‚áí SCADA `jobNo`‚Äù. |
| Sync Frequency      | How often we tap shoulders: every 30 s? hourly? |
| Conflict Strategy   | ‚ÄúLast writer wins‚Äù vs ‚ÄúAsk a human‚Äù. |
| Health Check        | A pulse check: ‚ÄúIs the outside system awake?‚Äù |

## 3. Use-Case Walk-Through: Keeping Flood Schedules Aligned

Goal: Any change to *either* HMS **or** the Corps‚Äô **SCADA** is mirrored within 30 seconds.

### 3.1 Define the Mapping (10 lines)

Create `flood-schedule.map.yml`:

```yaml
source: hms.floodSchedules           # HMS domain event
target: scada.job                    # external concept
fields:
  id: jobNo
  startTime: open_at
  endTime: close_at
strategy: bidirectional              # sync both ways
conflict: hms_wins                   # if simultaneous edits
```

Explanation  
‚Ä¢ `fields` translate JSON keys between the two worlds.  
‚Ä¢ `bidirectional` says: listen both directions.  
‚Ä¢ `conflict: hms_wins` keeps HMS as system-of-record.

### 3.2 Spin-Up the Adapter (15 lines)

```bash
# install once
npm i -g @hms/sync-cli

# run adapter with mapping file
hms-sync start flood-schedule.map.yml \
  --source-url nats://mesh.bus \
  --target-url tcp://scada.local:502
```

What happens?  
1. **Source side** subscribes to HMS event bus (`nats://‚Ä¶`).  
2. **Target side** opens a Modbus/TCP connection to the SCADA.  
3. The adapter now streams changes both ways‚Äîno code written!

### 3.3 Test the Loop (Node ‚â§ 12 lines)

```js
import { bus } from "@hms/sdk";

bus.emit("hms.floodSchedules.updated", {
  id: "LOCK-7",
  startTime: "2025-05-02T14:00Z",
  endTime: "2025-05-02T16:00Z"
});
```

Within seconds you‚Äôll see in adapter logs:

```
‚Üí HMS event received (LOCK-7)
‚Üí Translated ‚Üí SCADA { jobNo: 'LOCK-7', open_at: '14:00', close_at: '16:00' }
‚úî 200 OK (SCADA ACK)
```

Congrats‚Äîriver locks now obey the latest HMS policy!

## 4. Under the Hood: What *Actually* Happens

### 4.1 5-Participant Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant HMS as HMS Event Bus
    participant AD as Sync Adapter
    participant MAP as Mapping Engine
    participant EXT as SCADA PLC
    participant LED as Audit Ledger
    HMS->>AD: floodSchedules.updated
    AD->>MAP: translate(JSON)
    MAP-->>AD: Modbus packet
    AD->>EXT: writeRegister(...)
    AD->>LED: record sync
```

Step-by-step  
1. HMS publishes an **event**.  
2. Adapter hands payload to Mapping Engine.  
3. Engine rewrites keys & protocol.  
4. Adapter fires the command to SCADA.  
5. Success or failure is logged to the [Auditing & Traceability Ledger](13_auditing___traceability_ledger_.md).

### 4.2 Mini Internal Code Peek (18 lines)

_File `adapter/core.js` (simplified)_

```js
export async function handle(evt) {
  const map = await loadMap(evt.type);       // e.g., flood-schedule.map.yml
  const extMsg = translate(evt.data, map);   // key remap + type cast

  try {
    await target.write(extMsg);              // Modbus, SOAP, CSV, etc.
    ledger.ok(evt.id);                       // immutable success log
  } catch (e) {
    ledger.fail(evt.id, e);                  // so auditors can trace
    if (map.conflict !== "ignore") bus.emit("SYNC_ERROR", evt);
  }
}
```

Highlights  
‚Ä¢ `translate` applies YAML mapping.  
‚Ä¢ `target.write` uses protocol plug-ins (`modbus.js`, `soap.js`, ‚Ä¶).  
‚Ä¢ Any error is bubbled back as `SYNC_ERROR` for human-in-the-loop review (Chapter 12).

## 5. Hands-On Lab: Your First Adapter in 5 Minutes

1. Mock an external **CSV drop folder**:

   ```bash
   mkdir /tmp/legacy-payroll
   ```

2. Create mapping:

   ```yaml
   # payroll.map.yml
   source: hms.employeeHours
   target: csv.line
   fields:
     empId: column_1
     hours: column_2
   targetOptions:
     dir: /tmp/legacy-payroll
   ```

3. Start adapter:

   ```bash
   hms-sync start payroll.map.yml
   ```

4. Emit event:

   ```bash
   bus.emit("hms.employeeHours", { empId: "A123", hours: 8 })
   ```

5. Verify:

   ```bash
   cat /tmp/legacy-payroll/*.csv
   # ‚Üí "A123,8"
   ```

No boilerplate code, no rewriting the payroll app!

## 6. Common Questions

| Q | A |
|---|---|
| **Can one adapter handle multiple mappings?** | Yes‚Äîpass a folder: `hms-sync start ./maps/`. |
| **What about one-off backfills?** | Use `hms-sync replay --from 2024-01-01`. |
| **How fast is ‚Äúnear real-time‚Äù?** | Benchmarked at 2 000 msgs/sec with < 250 ms end-to-end lag. |
| **How are secrets (API keys) stored?** | Inside the [Security & Compliance Envelope](06_security___compliance_envelope_.md) vault; the adapter pulls short-lived tokens at start-up. |

## 7. What You Learned

‚Ä¢ External systems rarely speak HMS natively; an **Adapter** bridges the gap.  
‚Ä¢ Mapping files declare *what* to translate‚Äîno hard coding needed.  
‚Ä¢ Conflict strategies and health checks keep data trustworthy.  
‚Ä¢ All sync operations are auditable and secure by design.

Next, we‚Äôll dive deeper into how HMS keeps those adapters‚Äîand *every* component‚Äîsecure and compliant out-of-the-box.
