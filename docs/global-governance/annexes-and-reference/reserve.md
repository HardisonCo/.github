## 2. Technical Integration Architecture

### 2.1 API & Data Flow  
1. **Initiate Payment Request**  
   - RESERVE calls HMS-ACH REST API (`POST /payments`)  
   - Payload: beneficiary info, amount, funding source, payment date  
2. **Validation & Enrichment**  
   - HMS-ACH validates account details via microservice  
   - Enriches with NACHA formatting, bank routing lookups  
3. **Batch Creation & Transmission**  
   - HMS-ACH aggregates requests into ACH batches  
   - Secure transfer to the bank via SFTP or host-to-host API  
4. **Status Callbacks**  
   - Bank publishes the settlement status to HMS-ACH webhook  
   - HMS-ACH pushes status updates to RESERVE (`PUT /payments/{id}/status`)  

### 2.2 Authentication & Security  
- **OAuth2.0 / JWT** for REST API access  
- **Mutual TLS** on bank file-transfer channels  
- **Field-Level Encryption** for PII/financial data  
- **IP Allowlisting** and **API Gateway** for rate limiting  
- **Audit Logging** at every integration touchpoint  

### 2.3 Data Schema & Mapping  
| RESERVE Field      | HMS-ACH Field            | Transformation          |
|--------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| fund_center_id     | department_code          | one-to-one lookup       |
| payee_bank_ach     | ach_routing_number       | regex validation        |
| payee_account_ach  | ach_account_number       | masked storage          |
| payment_amount_usd | transaction_amount       | currency normalization  |
| scheduled_date     | effective_entry_date     | date format conversion  |

## 4. Implementation Considerations Specific to RESERVE

- **Regulatory & Compliance**  
  • Validate NACHA file specs against your bank’s current operating rules  
  • Ensure data residency requirements (e.g., FedRAMP for U.S. federal agencies)  
- **Infrastructure & Network**  
  • Provision secure SFTP/mTLS endpoints in RESERVE’s DMZ  
  • Set up dedicated message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, AWS SQS) for high‐volume bursts  
- **Data Governance & Mapping**  
  • Reconcile chart-of-accounts taxonomies between HMS-ACH and RESERVE  
  • Master Data Management (MDM) alignment for payees  
- **Change Management**  
  • Phased rollout by business unit (pilot → regional → enterprise)  
  • Training for finance and treasury on new dashboards and exception workflows  
- **Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity**  
  • Align HMS-ACH DR failover plans with RESERVE’s RTO/RPO objectives  
  • Cross-system backup and recovery drill schedules

## 5. Sample Use Cases

### Use Case A: Vendor Invoice Payment  
1. RESERVE approves vendor invoice in its ERP → triggers API call to HMS-ACH  
2. HMS-ACH validates account/routing → drafts ACH batch  
3. On settlement day, HMS-ACH transmits file to bank → posts success/failure back to RESERVE  
4. RESERVE automatically marks invoice as “Paid” and sends remittance advice to vendor  

### Use Case B: Emergency Reserve Disbursement  
1. Disaster response team in RESERVE initiates ad-hoc payment of relief funds  
2. HMS-ACH overrides standard schedule for same-day ACH (subject to bank cut-off)  
3. Real-time status update feeds into RESERVE’s situational dashboard  
4. Finance can reconcile exceptional disbursements and adjust cash reserves  

### Use Case C: Periodic Grant Payment Schedule  
1. RESERVE loads grant schedule via nightly batch to HMS-ACH  
2. HMS-ACH validates and queues each installment, flags duplicates  
3. Scheduled runs execute weekly ACH files; results sync back nightly  
4. Grant managers in RESERVE see disbursement statuses in one consolidated view
