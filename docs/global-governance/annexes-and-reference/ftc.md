# Federal Trade Commission (HMS-NFO Integration)

## Agency Overview

Uses big data and predictive analytics to uphold consumer protection and maintain competitive markets.

**Core Function:** Market competition preservation and consumer deception prevention

## First Principles Analysis

The FTC exists to ensure that markets function through genuine competition rather than deception or coercion. Its core function is preventing both unfair competition between businesses and unfair or deceptive practices targeting consumers. The agency operates on the principle that free markets require rules against both monopolistic behavior and consumer deception to function efficiently. Its dual consumer protection and competition mandates are complementary, recognizing that effective market oversight requires addressing both structural conditions that inhibit competition and specific practices that undermine consumer sovereignty.

### Fundamental Principles

- Market competition drives innovation and consumer benefits
- Monopoly power tends to reduce economic welfare and innovation
- Consumers cannot effectively evaluate false or misleading claims
- Commercial information asymmetries create exploitable power imbalances

### Key Mechanisms

- Review mergers to prevent harmful market concentration
- Challenge anticompetitive business practices
- Enforce rules against deceptive marketing and advertising
- Investigate and remedy unfair business practices
