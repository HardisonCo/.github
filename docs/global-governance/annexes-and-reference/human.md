## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Aligned to HUMAN’s Mission

HMS-ACH is designed for comprehensive health-care management, billing, and analytics. Key capabilities that directly support HUMAN’s goals of improving patient outcomes, operational efficiency, and data-driven decision-making are:

- **End-to-End Patient Management**  
  • Patient registration, scheduling, demographic updates  
  • Clinical encounters, care plans, treatment tracking  
- **Automated Clearing House (ACH) Billing & Claims**  
  • Electronic insurance claims submission (X12 837)  
  • Real-time eligibility verification (270/271)  
  • Automated remittance processing (835)  
- **Resource & Workforce Scheduling**  
  • Staff rostering, shift swaps, overtime tracking  
  • Room and equipment reservation dashboards  
- **Reporting & Analytics**  
  • Pre-built dashboards: utilization, revenue, patient flow  
  • Custom report engine with ad hoc querying  
- **Interoperability & Standards Support**  
  • HL7 v2/v3 messaging, FHIR® APIs  
  • CSV, JSON, XML import/export

## 2. Technical Integration

### 2.1 Architecture & Data Flow

```
[HUMAN Core Platform]
        │
        │ REST/JSON   ←─────────────┐
        │                          │
[API Gateway & Auth]              │
        │                          │
        │                          │
[HMS-ACH Services] ─── HL7/FHIR ──┘
        │
        │ MQ / Event Bus (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
        │
[Analytics Engine / Data Lake]
```

- **API Gateway**  
  • Central ingress for all HMS-ACH calls  
  • Enforces rate limits, monitoring, and security policies  
- **Data Exchange**  
  • **Synchronous calls** via RESTful FHIR endpoints for patient lookup, appointment booking  
  • **Asynchronous events** (e.g., claim status updates, bed availability) via message queue  
- **Data Persistence**  
  • Transactional DB for live operations  
  • Data warehouse or lake for analytics and reporting  

### 2.2 Authentication & Authorization

- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect**  
  • HUMAN issues tokens (access & refresh) to HMS-ACH  
  • Scopes restrict access to patient_read, claim_write, schedule_update, etc.  
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**  
  • Short-lived for API calls, carrying user roles and permissions  
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)**  
  • Optional for highly sensitive data flows (e.g., PHI transfer)  

### 2.3 Data Standards & Mapping

- **HL7 FHIR** as canonical data model  
- **X12** transaction sets for legacy claims  
- **Custom mapping layer** to translate HUMAN’s internal schemas ↔ HMS-ACH schemas

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

### 3.1 Operational Efficiency

- 40% faster patient check-in through automated demographic sync  
- 30% reduction in scheduling conflicts via real-time availability feeds  

### 3.2 Financial Performance

- 25% fewer claim denials by validating eligibility at scheduling  
- 20% decrease in days-in-AR (accounts receivable) with automated remittance processing  

### 3.3 Clinical Outcomes & Patient Satisfaction

- 15% improvement in patient follow-up adherence by coordinated care-plan reminders  
- Higher Net Promoter Score (NPS) through streamlined appointment experiences  

### 3.4 Data-Driven Governance

- Real-time dashboards for leadership on resource utilization, revenue trends  
- Predictive analytics for staffing and supply forecasting

## 4. HUMAN-Specific Implementation Considerations

- **Regulatory Compliance**  
  • Ensure HIPAA, GDPR adherence in data mapping, consent management  
- **Legacy System Coexistence**  
  • Phased cutover with dual-write strategy until decommissioning old billing system  
- **Change Management**  
  • Role-based training for clinical staff, billing clerks, and IT teams  
  • Sandbox and UAT environments mirroring production  
- **Data Migration & Cleansing**  
  • Audit existing patient and claims data  
  • Establish data quality rules and reconciliation processes  
- **Scalability & Resilience**  
  • Autoscaling Kubernetes deployment of HMS-ACH microservices  
  • Disaster recovery across two data centers

## 5. Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Real-Time Patient Check-In

1. Patient arrives and scans a QR code at HUMAN’s kiosk.  
2. Kiosk calls HMS-ACH `GET /Patient/{id}` via FHIR API.  
3. HMS-ACH returns up-to-date demographics, insurance info.  
4. HUMAN’s front-desk UI displays confirmation; any changes are written back via `PUT /Patient/{id}`.

**Outcome:** Average check-in time drops from 8 minutes to 3 minutes.

---

### Use Case 2: Automated Claim Submission & Remittance

1. Upon discharge, HMS-ACH triggers creation of an 837 claim.  
2. Claim is transmitted to payer via ACH network connector.  
3. Payer responds with 835 remittance; HMS-ACH parses and updates the claim status.  
4. HUMAN’s finance dashboard reflects payment posting in real time.

**Outcome:** Claim processing time reduced by 50%, cash-flow improved.

---

### Use Case 3: Dynamic Staffing Adjustment

1. HMS-ACH monitors daily patient admissions via an event feed.  
2. When occupancy exceeds 85%, it publishes a “HighDemand” event to Kafka.  
3. HUMAN’s workforce scheduler consumes the event and auto-proposes shift extensions.  
4. Notifications are sent via SMS/email to on-call staff for quick sign-up.

**Outcome:** Staffing shortages averted, patient satisfaction maintained.
