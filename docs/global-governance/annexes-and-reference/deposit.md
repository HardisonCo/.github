# HMS-ACH Integration with 

# Integration Analysis: HMS-ACH Component with DEPOSIT

This document outlines how the HMS-ACH subsystem would integrate with and enhance the DEPOSIT platform. It covers key capabilities, technical integration details, stakeholder benefits, implementation considerations, and end-to-end use cases.

---

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Aligned to DEPOSIT’s Mission

- **Automated NACHA-Compliant File Generation**  
  • Build ACH batch files (PPD, CCD, CTX) directly from DEPOSIT’s payment records  
  • Enforce NACHA formatting rules and record-type validations  
- **Real-Time Account Verification**  
  • Micro-deposit setup and zero-dollar pre-auth flows to validate routing and account numbers  
  • Instant feedback on bank status (open/closed/frozen)  
- **Exception & Return Management**  
  • Automated handling of “R-” return codes (e.g., R01-R99)  
  • Reversals and re-initiation workflows with configurable retry logic  
- **Secure Transmission & Compliance**  
  • End-to-end AES-256 encryption for files in transit and at rest  
  • Full audit trail, NACHA audit logs, and customizable retention policies  
- **Dashboard & Reporting**  
  • Real-time transaction dashboards, exception queues, and SLA alerts  
  • Exportable reports (CSV/PDF) on transaction volumes, return rates, and settlement times

## 2. Technical Integration Overview

### 2.1 Data Flow & APIs  
1. **Submission**  
   - DEPOSIT calls `POST /api/ach/batches` with JSON payload (batch header + entry details)  
2. **Validation & Enrichment**  
   - HMS-ACH responds synchronously with success/failure per entry  
   - Asynchronous webhook (`/api/ach/status`) notifies batch acceptance and NACHA file location  
3. **Transmission**  
   - HMS-ACH consolidates validated batches into NACHA files  
   - Files pushed over SFTP or Secure FTP-SSL to the ACH network  
4. **Status Updates**  
   - Webhooks trigger updates on:  
     • File accepted by ODFI  
     • Settlement completed (next‐day ACH)  
     • Return codes delivered  

### 2.2 Authentication & Security  
- **OAuth 2.0 / JWT** for API calls  
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** or client‐side certificates for SFTP endpoints  
- **IP whitelisting** and network segmentation  
- **Role-based access controls (RBAC)** within HMS-ACH for audit compliance

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Benefit Area                   | Baseline (Current)      | Post-Integration Target      |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| Manual Processing Time         | 4 business days         | < 2 business days            |
| Exception Resolution Rate      | ~ 40% manual follow-up  | ≥ 90% auto-resolved          |
| ACH Return Rate                | ~ 1.5%                  | < 1.0%                       |
| Audit & Compliance Overhead    | 20+ FTE hours/week      | 5 FTE hours/week             |
| End-to-end Visibility (TAT)    | 24–48 hrs per file      | Real-time dashboard (< 5 min)|

- **Cost Savings**: Reduced labor (FTE) and fewer bank fees from returns  
- **Customer Experience**: Faster funds availability and proactive exception alerts  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Automated NACHA validations and stamped audit logs

## 4. DEPOSIT-Specific Implementation Considerations

- **Data Mapping**  
  • Align DEPOSIT’s internal fields (e.g., customer ID, invoice #, amount) to ACH entry fields (trace #, RDFI #)  
- **Network & Infrastructure**  
  • Provision DMZ or VPN tunnel for SFTP/mTLS access  
  • Firewall rules to permit access to HMS-ACH API gateways and SFTP hosts  
- **Governance & Roles**  
  • Define “Payment Administrator” and “Viewer” roles within HMS-ACH  
  • Establish key‐rotation policies and certificate management  
- **Phased Roll-Out**  
  1. Pilot with low-risk transactions (e.g., small vendor refunds)  
  2. Expand to high-volume supplier payments  
  3. Onboard member dues and customer disbursements  
- **Training & Change Management**  
  • Technical workshops for IT/DevOps teams  
  • End-user guides for finance and operations

## 5. End-to-End Use Cases

### Use Case A: Monthly Vendor Rebate Disbursement  
1. DEPOSIT exports rebate report nightly.  
2. Script transforms CSV → JSON and invokes `POST /api/ach/batches`.  
3. HMS-ACH validates, returns batch ID.  
4. Next morning, webhook notifies “settled” status; DEPOSIT marks invoices paid.  

### Use Case B: Member Premium Collection  
1. Members submit bank info via DEPOSIT portal.  
2. HMS-ACH micro-deposits two $0.01 transactions; DEPOSIT verifies receipt.  
3. On approval, DEPOSIT schedules recurring CCD debit via HMS-ACH.  
4. Dashboard alerts finance on any return codes for manual follow-up.  

### Use Case C: Emergency Refund Processing  
1. DEPOSIT identifies customers eligible for a rapid refund.  
2. Admin triggers bulk refund job in DEPOSIT UI → HMS-ACH API.  
3. HMS-ACH auto‐routes via same‐day ACH rails (where supported).  
4. Real-time status webhooks update DEPOSIT; customers notified within hours.
