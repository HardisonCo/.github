# Social Security Administration (HMS-NFO Integration)

## Agency Overview

Utilizes data-driven insights and advanced automation to efficiently administer retirement, disability, and survivors' benefits.

**Core Function:** Universal social insurance administration

## First Principles Analysis

The SSA exists to provide income security against the financial risks of aging, disability, and death of a family breadwinner. Its core function is administering social insurance programs that provide predictable benefits based on earnings history. The agency operates on the principle that certain economic risks are best addressed through universal participation and pooled resources rather than individual market solutions. Its structure balances efficient benefit delivery with careful determination of eligibility, recognizing that effective social insurance requires both accurate implementation of program rules and sensitivity to the vulnerable populations served.

### Fundamental Principles

- Aging and disability create universal economic vulnerabilities requiring protection
- Income security requires lifetime contribution system paired with guaranteed benefits
- Intergenerational risk pooling enables retirement planning regardless of market conditions
- Massive scale operations require standardized processes with individual adjustments

### Key Mechanisms

- Collect payroll taxes from nearly all workers and employers
- Track lifetime earnings to calculate future benefits
- Process and pay monthly benefits to eligible recipients
- Determine eligibility for disability based on medical and vocational factors
