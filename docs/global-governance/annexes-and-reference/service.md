## 1. Key Capabilities of HMS-ACH for SERVICE

- **Automated Claims Submission & Tracking**  
  - Generates and submits X12-837 (professional/institutional) claims in real time  
  - Tracks claim lifecycle: submission → adjudication → payment  
  - Provides real-time status updates, reducing manual follow-up

- **Eligibility & Benefits Verification**  
  - On-demand insurance eligibility checks via X12-270/271  
  - Validates member coverage, copays, deductibles before service delivery  
  - Reduces denials and patient billing surprises

- **Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) Processing**  
  - Ingests X12-835 remittance files to reconcile payments automatically  
  - Matches payments to claims, posts adjustments to patient accounts  
  - Improves accuracy of the revenue cycle

- **Denial Management & Appeal Workflows**  
  - Flags denied or underpaid claims, categorizes by denial code  
  - Automates appeal letter generation and resubmission  
  - Provides dashboard for denial trends and root-cause analysis

- **Reporting & Analytics**  
  - Pre-built revenue cycle KPIs: days in A/R, clean claim rate, denial rate  
  - Customizable dashboards for financial performance monitoring  
  - Drill-down capability by payer, provider, service line

## 2. Technical Integration Architecture

### 2.1 APIs & Data Exchange

- **RESTful Services**  
  - HMS-ACH exposes endpoints for claim submission, status inquiry, ERA retrieval  
  - SERVICE calls POST /claims, GET /claims/{id}/status, POST /eligibility  

- **Batch File Transfer**  
  - SFTP/FTPS drop zones for bulk claims (X12 files) and ERA downloads  
  - Automated polling jobs on both HMS-ACH and SERVICE sides  

- **Standards & Formats**  
  - X12 EDI (837, 835, 270/271) for payer communications  
  - JSON/XML payloads for internal SERVICE system integration  

### 2.2 Data Flows

1. **Patient Encounter**  
   - SERVICE logs encounter → pushes demographic & encounter data to HMS-ACH via API  
2. **Eligibility Check**  
   - SERVICE triggers `/eligibility` → HMS-ACH queries payer → returns coverage details  
3. **Claim Generation & Submission**  
   - SERVICE calls `/claims` with service details → HMS-ACH builds 837 → transmits to clearinghouse/payers  
4. **Status & Remittance**  
   - HMS-ACH streams status updates & ERAs back to SERVICE via webhooks or file drop  
   - SERVICE ingests remittance data → updates patient account balances  

### 2.3 Security & Authentication

- **OAuth2 / OpenID Connect**  
  - Token-based access to HMS-ACH APIs  
  - Fine-grained scopes (e.g., `claims:write`, `eligibility:read`)  
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)**  
  - Ensures system-to-system authentication for batch SFTP transfers  
- **Data Encryption**  
  - In transit: TLS 1.2+ for all HTTP traffic  
  - At rest: AES-256 on files and databases

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Stakeholder      | Benefit                               | Metrics / KPIs                           |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| SERVICE Finance  | Faster cash flow                      | ↓ Days in A/R (target: –20%)             |
|                  | Reduced denials                       | ↓ Denial rate (target: –30%)             |
| Revenue Cycle Ops| Lower manual effort                   | ↓ Manual claim re-submissions            |
|                  | Enhanced visibility                  | Real-time dashboards & alerts            |
| Patients         | Clearer billing                       | ↑ First-pass clean claims (target: 95%)  |
| IT / DevOps      | Simplified integration maintenance    | Fewer custom interfaces to payers        |

- **Accelerated Revenue Cycle**: Automated workflows cut cycle time by 25–40%.  
- **Improved Data Accuracy**: Standardized EDI reduces errors by 50%.  
- **Operational Efficiency**: Staff reallocate ~30% effort from manual billing tasks to value-added activities.

## 4. SERVICE-Specific Implementation Considerations

- **Data Mapping & Field Alignment**  
  - Align SERVICE’s data model (patient, provider, procedure codes) with HMS-ACH schema  
  - Establish code sets: CPT, HCPCS, ICD-10, NPI  

- **Workflow Orchestration**  
  - Embed eligibility checks in SERVICE’s appointment booking flow  
  - Trigger claim submission automatically upon encounter closure  

- **Exception Handling**  
  - Define routing rules for claims requiring manual review (e.g., unusual modifiers)  
  - Configure alert thresholds for spike in denials or payer rejections  

- **Testing & Compliance**  
  - End-to-end testing in a sandbox environment with synthetic payer data  
  - Validate with HIPAA risk assessment and security audits  

- **Change Management & Training**  
  - Develop user guides for revenue cycle team  
  - Conduct workshops on dashboard interpretation and denial management tools

## 5. Use Cases

### 5.1 Real-Time Eligibility at Point of Care

1. Patient checks in on SERVICE portal  
2. SERVICE calls HMS-ACH `/eligibility` → returns active coverage, copay amount  
3. Front-desk displays estimated patient responsibility  
4. Patient pays copay upfront, reducing downstream collections  

_Impact_: 20% fewer no-shows for billing surprises; 15% increase in up-front collections.

---

### 5.2 Automated Claim Submission & Status Updates

1. Clinician completes encounter → SERVICE triggers claim creation  
2. HMS-ACH builds and sends X12-837 to clearinghouse  
3. HMS-ACH polls payer for status → pushes webhook to SERVICE  
4. SERVICE dashboard shows “Accepted”, “Pending” or “Denied” in real time  

_Impact_: Claims move from submission to first payment 35% faster; staff downtime for status checks drops by half.

---

### 5.3 Denial Management & Appeal Automation

1. Payer returns X12-997/277 CA (rejection/ack) with denial codes  
2. HMS-ACH categorizes denial, auto-generates appeal template  
3. SERVICE’s billing team reviews and initiates appeal via one-click in dashboard  
4. HMS-ACH re-submits corrected claim or appeal package  

_Impact_: Appeals success rate +25%; denial backlog cleared 40% faster.
