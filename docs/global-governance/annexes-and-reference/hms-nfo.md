- Automated resource sharing

### Project Implementation Tracking

#### Legacy Approach

Quarterly manual progress reports with limited verification

#### AI-Powered Approach

Real-time project monitoring with automated milestone verification and risk detection

- Data-driven resource allocation

## Implementation Example

```python
from hms.client import HMSClient
from hms.components import hmsnfo

# Initialize the HMS client with authentication
client = HMSClient(
    agency="PeaceCorps",
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    environment="production"
)

# Initialize the HMS-NFO component
nfo = client.get_component('hms-nfo')

# Economic analysis example
analysis_result = nfo.analyze_opportunities(
    sectors=["manufacturing", "technology", "agriculture"],
    regions=["asia_pacific", "north_america", "europe"],
    timeframe="next_quarter",
    analysis_type="growth_potential",
    minimum_confidence=0.7
)

print(f"Found {len(analysis_result['opportunities'])} high-confidence opportunities")
for opportunity in analysis_result['opportunities'][:3]:
    print(f"- {opportunity['title']} (Score: {opportunity['confidence_score']})")
```
