# Integration of HMS-ACH with TECHNICAL

This document describes how the HMS-ACH (Hospital Management System – Automated Claims & Payment Hub) component can integrate with and benefit the TECHNICAL platform.  

---

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing TECHNICAL’s Mission Needs

- **Automated Claims Submission & Adjudication**  
  - Real-time generation and routing of insurance claims (ANSI X12 837)  
  - Rule-based validation engine to catch errors before submission  
- **Payment Processing & Reconciliation**  
  - Automated receipt of EDI 835 remittance advice  
  - ACH transaction orchestration for direct deposits to provider bank accounts  
- **Patient Eligibility & Benefits Verification**  
  - On-demand checks against payer portals (via FHIR or X12 270/271)  
- **Reporting & Analytics**  
  - KPIs on claim denial rates, payment turnaround time, cash-flow forecasting  
  - Custom dashboards and scheduled batch reports  
- **Compliance & Audit Trail**  
  - Full traceability of claim lifecycle events  
  - Encryption-at-rest and detailed audit logs for HIPAA and GDPR  

These capabilities directly support TECHNICAL’s goals of reducing revenue cycle friction, minimizing manual intervention, and improving financial visibility.

## 2. Technical Integration

### 2.1 APIs & Messaging

- **RESTful Endpoints**  
  - `/claims` (POST) to submit claims in JSON or EDI 837 format  
  - `/remittance` (GET) to pull 835 remittance data  
  - `/eligibility` (POST) to verify patient coverage via FHIR 4.0  
- **HL7/FHIR Interfaces**  
  - FHIR `Claim` and `ClaimResponse` resources for in-workflow adjudication  
  - HL7 v2.x ORU^R01 for updates to TECHNICAL’s EMR module  
- **Batch File Exchange**  
  - SFTP server for scheduled batch transmission of settlement files (CSV/EDI)  

### 2.2 Data Flows

1. **Patient Check-in**: TECHNICAL’s registration system sends demographics → HMS-ACH via FHIR Patient  
2. **Eligibility**: HMS-ACH queries payers, returns coverage details → TECHNICAL displays benefit summary  
3. **Claim Generation**: TECHNICAL billing module invokes `/claims` API with consolidated charges  
4. **Adjudication & Remittance**: Payer responses ingested by HMS-ACH, posted to TECHNICAL through `/remittance`  
5. **Reconciliation**: End-of‐day ACH transactions reconciled automatically; status updates back to TECHNICAL  

### 2.3 Authentication & Security

- **OAuth 2.0 (Client Credentials Grant)** for REST APIs  
- **Mutual TLS** for batch/SFTP connectivity  
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** with short-lived scopes (`claims:write`, `remittance:read`)  
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)** ensures only authorized TECHNICAL services can invoke sensitive endpoints

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

- **Faster Claims Turnaround**  
  - Reduction from 7 days to < 24 hours for initial submission and adjudication  
- **Lower Denial Rates**  
  - Rule-based pre‐submission checks cut denials by up to 30%  
- **Improved Cash Flow**  
  - Automated ACH pushes reduce manual lockbox processing time by 80%  
- **Operational Efficiency**  
  - 60% fewer manual reconciliations; staff redeployed to higher‐value tasks  
- **Transparency & Reporting**  
  - Real-time dashboards reduce time to financial close by 2 days/month  

Key metrics can be tracked in TECHNICAL’s BI module by pulling HMS-ACH analytics via the `/reports` API.

## 4. Implementation Considerations for TECHNICAL

- **Data Mapping & Transformation**  
  - Align TECHNICAL charge codes and CPT/ICD mappings with HMS-ACH schemas  
- **Network & Firewall Configuration**  
  - Open designated ports for OAuth token server, REST APIs, and SFTP  
- **Scalability & Performance**  
  - Load-test concurrent claim submissions (target > 500 TPS)  
  - Implement queuing (e.g., RabbitMQ) for peak loads  
- **Security & Compliance**  
  - Ensure encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256)  
  - Conduct joint penetration testing and audit reviews  
- **Change Management & Training**  
  - Update TECHNICAL’s billing SOPs to reflect automated exception workflows  
  - Provide user training on new dashboard and reconciliation tools

## 5. Use Cases

### Use Case A: Real-Time Eligibility Check
1. Receptionist enters patient ID in TECHNICAL’s portal.  
2. TECHNICAL calls HMS-ACH `/eligibility` API.  
3. HMS-ACH returns coverage details and co-pay amounts.  
4. Receptionist confirms and schedules appointment with no billing surprises.

### Use Case B: Automated Claims Cycle
1. After patient visit, TECHNICAL billing posts charges to `/claims`.  
2. HMS-ACH validates, enriches, and routes claim to payer.  
3. Once payer adjudicates, HMS-ACH pushes EDI 835 to TECHNICAL.  
4. TECHNICAL auto-applies payments and flags under-payments for review.

### Use Case C: End-of-Day ACH Reconciliation
1. HMS-ACH compiles daily ACH file for provider payments.  
2. TECHNICAL’s finance system retrieves file via SFTP.  
3. Transactions auto-match with invoices; exceptions get a case ticket.  
4. CFO reviews summary dashboard showing 98% auto-match rate.
