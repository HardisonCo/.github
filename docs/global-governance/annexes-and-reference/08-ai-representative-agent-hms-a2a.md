# Chapter 8: AI Representative Agent (HMS-A2A)

[← Back to Chapter 7: Process & Policy Builder](07_process___policy_builder_.md)

## 1. Why Do We Need a “Super-Powered Legislative Aide”?

Picture the Veterans’ Employment and Training Service (**VETS**).  
Every night thousands of résumé‐review requests pile up.  
Humans eventually notice that **Form VTR-19** always bottlenecks on the same missing field—*“Years of Civilian Experience.”*

What if, before anyone complained, an **AI Representative Agent** inside HMS-MKT:

1. Read the processing logs  
2. Detected the delay pattern  
3. Drafted a one-line fix marking that field “optional”  
4. Filed a **digital motion** (a pull request) to the policy JSON  
5. Waited politely for a human officer to click **Approve**

That is **HMS-A2A** in action—a tireless aide who scans data, suggests improvements, and even ships them when allowed.

---

## 2. Big Ideas in Plain English

| Term | Beginner-Friendly Meaning |
|------|--------------------------|
| Observation Window | The log or telemetry slice the agent studies (e.g., “last 24 h of VTR-19 failures”). |
| Insight | A pattern the agent flags (“80 % of failures = missing ‘Years of Civilian Experience’”). |
| Digital Motion | A proposed change—code diff, policy clause edit, config tweak—filed as a pull request. |
| Human Assent | A required thumbs-up before merge (links to [Human-in-the-Loop Oversight](09_human_in_the_loop__hitl__oversight_.md)). |
| Autonomous Mode | When governance permits, the agent can merge & deploy without waiting (rare, high-trust). |
| Telemetry Loop | Post-deployment watch to confirm the change actually helped. |

> Analogy: A junior staffer spots a typo in a bill, drafts the correction, hands it to the committee chair, and later checks that the Congressional Record shows the fix.

## 3. A 5-Minute “Hello A2A” Demo

Goal: let the agent propose making a form field optional.

### 3.1 Calling the Agent (Front-End or CLI, ≤ 15 lines)

```js
// File: services/a2aClient.js
export async function proposeFix(context) {
  const res = await fetch('/api/a2a/propose', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type':'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(context)        // logs, schema path, etc.
  })
  return res.json()                      // { prUrl:"https://git.../123" }
}
```

Explanation  
1. Send *context* (e.g., failing log sample) to `/a2a/propose`.  
2. Receive the URL of a freshly-opened pull request—our **digital motion**.

### 3.2 What the Motion Looks Like (Git-Style Diff, 6 lines)

```diff
- "yearsOfCivilianExp": { "type":"number", "required":true }
+ "yearsOfCivilianExp": { "type":"number", "required":false }
```

The agent adds a commit message:

> “Observed 1 245 validation failures for ‘yearsOfCivilianExp’.  
> Recommending optional to reduce drop-offs.”

Humans can now review, comment, and merge.

## 4. Step-By-Step: How the Agent Operates

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CRON as Scheduler
    participant A2A as AI Rep Agent
    participant GH as Code Host
    participant GOV as Governance
    participant OFF as Human Officer

    CRON->>A2A: analyze logs (daily)
    A2A->>A2A: detect pattern & craft diff
    A2A->>GH: open pull request            %% digital motion
    GH-->>OFF: email "PR #123 needs review"
    OFF->>GH: approve / comment
    GH->>GOV: deploy w/ policy stamp
    A2A->>A2A: monitor telemetry post-merge
```

Plain English  
1. A scheduler wakes the agent.  
2. The agent finds a pain point and drafts a fix.  
3. A pull request is opened; no code is merged yet.  
4. A human officer makes the final call (link to Chapter 9).  
5. After deployment, the agent double-checks that failure rates drop.

## 5. Peeking Under the Hood (Tiny Implementation Stubs)

### 5.1 The Analyzer (≤ 20 lines)

```js
// File: a2a/analyze.js
import fs from 'fs'
export function findTopError(logPath) {
  const txt = fs.readFileSync(logPath,'utf8')
  const lines = txt.split('\n')
  const stats = {}
  lines.forEach(l=>{
    const m = l.match(/ERROR: (.+)/)
    if (m) stats[m[1]] = (stats[m[1]]||0)+1
  })
  return Object.entries(stats).sort((a,b)=>b[1]-a[1])[0]  // [msg,count]
}
```

Beginner notes  
• Reads a plain text log, tallies error messages, returns the most frequent one.

### 5.2 Drafting the Pull Request (≤ 20 lines)

```js
// File: a2a/draftPR.js
import { Octokit } from 'octokit'
const gh = new Octokit({ auth: process.env.GH_TOKEN })

export async function openPr(branch, diff, msg) {
  await gh.request('POST /repos/{r}/git/refs', {
    r:'hms-mkt/forms', ref:'refs/heads/'+branch, sha:process.env.BASE_SHA })
  await gh.request('POST /repos/{r}/contents/{path}', {
    r:'hms-mkt/forms', path:'VTR-19.json',
    message:msg, content:Buffer.from(diff).toString('base64'),
    branch })
  const pr = await gh.request('POST /repos/{r}/pulls', {
    r:'hms-mkt/forms', head:branch, base:'main', title:msg })
  return pr.data.html_url
}
```

Explanation  
1. Creates a new branch.  
2. Writes the modified JSON (content is tiny for demo).  
3. Opens a pull request and returns its URL.

### 5.3 Glue Job (≤ 15 lines)

```js
// File: a2a/job.js
import { findTopError } from './analyze.js'
import { openPr } from './draftPR.js'

const [err,count] = findTopError('/var/log/form.log')
if (err.includes('yearsOfCivilianExp missing')) {
  const diff = /* string with one-line change, omitted */
  const url  = await openPr(
      'a2a-optional-field',
      diff,
      `Make field optional – observed ${count} failures`)
  console.log('Digital motion filed:', url)
}
```

Run with `node a2a/job.js` via cron or Kubernetes `CronJob`.

## 6. Safety Rails & Policies

1. **RBAC Scope**: the agent holds the role `AI_Aide`, mapping to permissions `forms.read logs.read pullreq.write`—nothing else.  
2. **Governance Stamp**: the pull request must include an *auto-generated* compliance checklist (`required evidence ✔️`). HMS-GOV blocks merge if the checklist fails.  
3. **Human-in-the-Loop**: default branch protection **requires** a human review (see next chapter).  
4. **Rollback Hook**: if telemetry shows error rate *increases*, the agent automatically reverts via `git revert` and files an incident report.

---

## 7. Using A2A Suggestions Inside the Builder

Remember the drag-and-drop **Process & Policy Builder** from Chapter 7?  
Click **“AI Suggest”** and the Builder calls:

```js
await fetch('/api/a2a/suggest?policyId=HHA-2024')
```

The agent replies with a ranked list of possible optimizations (“Merge ‘Income Check’ and ‘Eligibility’ clauses”). Users can accept with one click.

---

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does A2A deploy code by itself?**  
A: Only if a policy explicitly grants **Autonomous Mode** and runtime telemetry shows low risk. Otherwise a human must merge.

**Q: What models power it?**  
A: A thin wrapper over an OpenAI-compatible endpoint plus rule-based templates—easily swapped for on-prem LLMs.

**Q: How big can a digital motion be?**  
A: Any size. We recommend **one logical change per motion** so reviewers can focus.

**Q: What if the agent makes a bad suggestion?**  
A: Simply close the pull request. Feedback is logged; the agent uses it to reduce similar false positives.

## 9. Recap & What’s Next

You met the **AI Representative Agent (HMS-A2A)**—a diligent aide that:

• Reads logs and policies  
• Drafts improvements as **digital motions**  
• Respects governance, RBAC, and human oversight  
• Monitors impact after deployment  

Next, we’ll dive into the humans who supervise these AI motions, ensuring no rogue change slips through the cracks:
