# National Transportation Safety Board (HMS-NFO Integration)

## Agency Overview

Investigates transportation accidents to improve safety standards across aviation, highways, railroads, marine, and pipelines.

**Core Function:** Independent transportation failure analysis

## First Principles Analysis

The NTSB exists to improve transportation safety through independent investigation of accidents and systematic identification of causal factors. Its fundamental purpose is determining what happened, why it happened, and how similar events can be prevented. The agency operates on the principle that safety advancement requires fact-based analysis separated from regulatory or operational responsibilities. Its investigative process emphasizes thoroughness rather than speed, recognizing that effective safety improvement requires both technical expertise across transportation modes and independence from both industry and regulatory entities.

### Fundamental Principles

- Complex transportation systems require systemic analysis of failures
- Accident investigation independence prevents conflict of interest in findings
- Safety advancement requires understanding causation beyond individual events
- Recurring transportation safety patterns need identification across modes

### Key Mechanisms

- Deploy specialized technical teams to accident sites
- Create factual records and analysis separate from regulatory functions
- Identify causal factors through scientific investigation
- Issue recommendations to prevent similar accidents

## HMS-NFO Integration

The HMS-NFO system provides specialized data and analytics services tailored to National Transportation Safety Board's mission. The following components are particularly relevant:

- **Internet Data Collection System**: Gathers trade and economic data from public sources
- **Data Access API**: Provides standardized access to HMS-NFO data
