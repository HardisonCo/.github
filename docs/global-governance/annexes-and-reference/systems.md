# HMS-ACH Integration with 

# Integration of the HMS-ACH Component with SYSTEMS

This document outlines how the HMS-ACH (Hospital Management System – Admission, Charge & Handoff) component can be integrated into the existing SYSTEMS platform, addressing mission needs, technical approaches, benefits, implementation considerations, and illustrative use cases.

## 1. Key Capabilities of HMS-ACH for SYSTEMS’ Mission

- **Patient Onboarding & Registration**  
  • Real-time capture of demographics, insurance, consent forms  
  • Automated duplicate-record detection and merging  
  • Fast-track admissions for critical/emergency cases

- **Charge Capture & Billing**  
  • Itemized capture of procedures, medications, room charges  
  • Integration with payer rules engines for eligibility checks  
  • Automated invoice generation and electronic remittance advice (ERA)

- **Handoff & Discharge Coordination**  
  • Task lists for nursing, pharmacy, transport  
  • Discharge summaries and referral tracking  
  • Post-discharge follow-up scheduling

- **Analytics & Reporting**  
  • Dashboards for bed utilization, length-of-stay, AR days  
  • Custom report builder for finance, compliance, quality metrics  
  • Alerts and notifications for exceptions (e.g., delayed discharges)

## 2. Technical Integration Architecture

### 2.1 APIs & Data Flows
- **RESTful Endpoints (JSON)** for CRUD operations on:
  - `/patients`
  - `/admissions`
  - `/charges`
  - `/discharges`
- **HL7 FHIR** interfaces for EHR-centric payloads (e.g., Patient, Encounter, ChargeItem)
- **Event-Driven Messaging** via a message broker (e.g., Kafka/RabbitMQ) for:
  - Admission start/completion events
  - Billing event triggers
  - Discharge notifications

### 2.2 Authentication & Security
- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect**  
  - SYSTEMS as OAuth client  
  - Token exchange to obtain scoped JWTs  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  - Fine-grained scopes (e.g., `hms.read.admissions`, `hms.write.charges`)  
- **Transport Security**  
  - TLS 1.2+ for all API calls  
  - Mutual TLS optional for high-security zones

### 2.3 Data Mapping & Transformation
- **Canonical Data Model** in SYSTEMS to map:
  - HMS-ACH patient IDs ↔ SYSTEMS master patient index  
  - Charge codes ↔ internal service catalog  
- **Middleware** or ESB layer (if used) handles:
  - Field transformation  
  - Code set translation (CPT/ICD → internal codes)

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Stakeholder   | Benefit                                        | Metric / KPI                                 |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Clinical Ops  | Faster admissions; fewer errors                | Avg. registration time ↓ by 30%               |
| Finance       | Automated billing accuracy & speed             | Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) ↓ by 15%         |
| IT / DevOps   | Standardized API-driven integration footprint  | Integration build time ↓ by 40%               |
| Executive     | Real-time visibility into utilization & revenue| Dashboard adoption rate; decision cycle time  |

- **Data Accuracy**  
  Reduction in manual data entry errors by up to 75%.

- **Operational Efficiency**  
  Bed turnaround time improved by 20% through better admission/discharge coordination.

- **Revenue Capture**  
  Denials due to coding errors cut by 25%, boosting net collections.

## 4. Implementation Considerations

- **Regulatory Compliance**
  - HIPAA (US) / GDPR (EU) data handling safeguards  
  - Audit logging for all PHI transactions

- **Infrastructure**
  - High-availability clusters for critical API services  
  - Disaster recovery / failover strategy for the message broker

- **Change Management**
  - Training programs for clinical and billing staff  
  - Phased rollout: Pilot → Regional deployments → Full scale

- **Data Migration & Testing**
  - Bulk migrate existing admissions and charge history  
  - End-to-end test scenarios: admission → discharge → billing  
  - User acceptance tests with parallel run against legacy

- **Monitoring & Support**
  - Application performance monitoring (APM) dashboards  
  - 24×7 support SLA for integration endpoints

## 5. Use Cases

### 5.1 Emergency Admission Fast-Track
1. ER nurse scans patient ID → SYSTEMS pushes minimal demographics to HMS-ACH.  
2. HMS-ACH allocates a bed, issues admission record.  
3. SYSTEMS receives `AdmissionConfirmation` event; updates bed-management dashboard.

### 5.2 Automated Charge Posting
1. Clinical system completes procedure entry → emits a FHIR `ChargeItem` to HMS-ACH.  
2. HMS-ACH applies business rules, posts charge to patient account.  
3. SYSTEMS billing module pulls the posted charge via `/charges` API hourly; queues for claims.

### 5.3 Coordinated Discharge & Follow-Up
1. Physician signs discharge summary in HMS-ACH.  
2. HMS-ACH triggers a `DischargeReady` event.  
3. SYSTEMS schedules home-care nurse visit, sends patient SMS with instructions.  
4. On completion, follow-up outcome logged back into HMS-ACH for quality reporting.

By leveraging HMS-ACH’s specialized admission, charge capture, and handoff functionality, SYSTEMS gains a unified, API-driven platform that accelerates patient throughput, tightens revenue cycles, and enhances data-driven decision-making across clinical and administrative domains.
