# Integration of HMS-ACH with BOARD

This document outlines how the HMS-ACH system component can be integrated with BOARD’s Corporate Performance Management (CPM) platform, the technical underpinnings of that integration, and the tangible benefits for BOARD stakeholders.

## 1. Specific HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing BOARD’s Mission Needs

BOARD’s mission is to deliver unified planning, budgeting, forecasting, reporting and analytics across the enterprise. HMS-ACH brings healthcare-centric operational and financial data that enriches BOARD’s models:

- **Real-Time Patient Activity**  
  - Admissions/Discharges/Transfers (ADT) streams  
  - Bed occupancy & resource utilization metrics  
- **Revenue Cycle & Claims Data**  
  - Automated claims submission status  
  - Payer mix and reimbursement rate details  
- **Care Pathway & Cost Analytics**  
  - Procedure codes (CPT/ICD) with cost buckets  
  - Length-of-stay vs. cost variance  
- **Capacity & Staffing**  
  - Shift schedules, staff-to-patient ratios  
  - Overtime and agency usage  
- **Regulatory & Quality KPIs**  
  - Readmission rates, HCAHPS scores  
  - Compliance checklists (e.g., HIPAA, Joint Commission)

Together, these capabilities feed BOARD’s financial models and operational dashboards with healthcare-specific intelligence.

## 2. Technical Integration Architecture

### 2.1 APIs & Connectors
- **RESTful Services**  
  - HMS-ACH publishes endpoints for ADT events, claims statuses, cost ledgers  
  - JSON payloads with standard healthcare schemas (HL7 FHIR–compatible)  
- **OData / SQL Connectors**  
  - BOARD’s data modeling layer can consume HMS-ACH’s published OData feeds  
  - Direct JDBC/ODBC queries against HMS-ACH DW for bulk loads

### 2.2 Data Flows
1. **Event-Driven Updates (Near Real-Time)**  
   - HMS-ACH pushes ADT and billing events onto a message broker (e.g., Kafka/RabbitMQ)  
   - A lightweight adapter ingests messages into BOARD’s staging area via BOARD REST API  
2. **Batch ETL**  
   - Nightly extract of transactional tables (patients, claims, cost centers)  
   - Transform/cleanse with BOARD ETL toolkit  
   - Load into BOARD’s in-memory analytical cube  

### 2.3 Authentication & Security
- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect** for API token issuance  
- **Mutual TLS** between HMS-ACH and BOARD integration nodes  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  - HMS-ACH system roles map to BOARD user groups  
- **Data Encryption**  
  - In-transit: TLS 1.2+  
  - At-rest: AES-256 in BOARD repository

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements for BOARD Stakeholders

| Stakeholder       | Benefit                                          | Metric / KPI                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Finance (CFO)     | More accurate revenue forecasting                | Forecast error ↓ 15%              |
| Operations (COO)  | Real-time bed/capacity planning                  | Occupancy planning lag ↓ 8 hrs    |
| Clinical Leads    | Visibility into cost-of-care per pathway         | Cost variance per DRG ↓ 10%       |
| IT / Data Teams   | Streamlined data pipelines & maintenance         | ETL dev time ↓ 40%                |
| Compliance / QA   | Automated quality KPI tracking                   | Manual reporting effort ↓ 50%     |

- Faster “what-if” scenario modeling (e.g., pandemic surge planning)  
- Reduced manual reconciliation between clinical and financial data  
- Unified single source of truth for all enterprise planning

## 4. Implementation Considerations Specific to BOARD

- **Data Model Alignment**  
  - Extend BOARD’s standard healthcare data mart (e.g., add new HMS-ACH dimensions: claim lifecycle, pathway codes)  
- **Governance & Privacy**  
  - Ensure PHI masking or pseudonymization before loading into BOARD’s non-clinical environments  
  - Audit logging for data access (retain logs per HIPAA 164.312)  
- **Environment Strategy**  
  - Dev/Test/Prod farms in BOARD Cloud or on-prem  
  - CI/CD pipelines for BOARD model & ETL deployments  
- **Performance Tuning**  
  - Pre-aggregate heavy measures in HMS-ACH to reduce load in BOARD in-memory cube  
  - Use BOARD’s Smart Cache for frequently queried healthcare KPIs  
- **Change Management & Training**  
  - Joint workshops for finance, operations and IT on new dashboards  
  - Documentation of data lineage from HMS-ACH → BOARD

## 5. Sample Use Cases

### 5.1 Daily Capacity & Revenue Dashboard  
- **Flow**: HMS-ACH pushes ADT + claims updates → BOARD cube  
- **BOARD Output**:  
  - Real-time bed occupancy vs. forecast  
  - YTD revenue by payer & procedure code  
  - Drill-down from hospital → department → service line  

### 5.2 Rolling Forecast Adjustment  
- **Trigger**: Surge in ER admissions  
- **Process**:  
  1. HMS-ACH event notifies BOARD of 20% uptick in daily admissions  
  2. BOARD automatically re-runs volume-based revenue forecast  
  3. Finance reviews suggested budget adjustments in BOARD’s planning module  
- **Outcome**: Immediate reallocation of staffing budgets and supplies  

### 5.3 Care Pathway Cost Variance Analysis  
- **Data**: Procedural costs, length-of-stay from HMS-ACH + budgeted standards in BOARD  
- **BOARD Visualization**:  
  - Heatmap of DRGs by cost variance  
  - Predictive alerts where cost overruns > 5%  
- **Action**: Identify root causes (staffing mix, implant costs) and update provider contracts

By tightly integrating HMS-ACH’s healthcare operations and financial streams with BOARD’s planning and analytics engine, organizations gain end-to-end visibility, faster decision cycles, and measurable improvements in efficiency, accuracy and compliance.
