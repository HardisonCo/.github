# Integration of HMS-ACH Module with RECORDS

This document analyzes how the HMS-ACH (Automated Clearing House) component of the HMS platform can be integrated with and deliver measurable benefits to the RECORDS system, addressing mission-critical needs, technical integration, stakeholder gains, and implementation considerations.

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing RECORDS’ Mission

1. **Automated Claims Submission & Reconciliation**  
   - Batch‐ and real‐time ACH transactions for insurance claims  
   - Electronic claim status tracking (ANSI X12 276/277)  
   - Automated posting of payments and denials  

2. **Eligibility & Benefit Verification**  
   - On-demand insurer eligibility checks (270/271)  
   - Automated benefit pre-authorization workflows  
   - Alerts for coverage gaps or prior-authorization requirements  

3. **Payment Remittance & Reporting**  
   - Standardized 835 remittance advice ingestion  
   - Detailed payment‐to‐claim matching and exception reporting  
   - Customizable dashboards (e.g., days in A/R, net collection rate)  

4. **Compliance & Audit Trail**  
   - Full HIPAA-compliant encryption (in-transit & at-rest)  
   - Immutable transaction logs with timestamps and user stamps  
   - Audit reports for internal and regulatory review

## 2. Technical Integration Overview

### 2.1 APIs & Data Flows
- **RESTful Endpoints**  
  - `/ach/submitClaim` (JSON payload) → returns `claimID`, status  
  - `/ach/queryEligibility` → returns coverage details  
  - `/ach/fetchRemittance` → returns 835 data in JSON/XML  
- **Webhooks/Callbacks**  
  - `POST /records/ach/callback` for real-time status updates  
- **Batch‐File Exchange**  
  - SFTP drop zones for large X12 file sets (e.g., 837, 835)  

### 2.2 Data Mapping & Transformation
- **HL7/FHIR ↔ X12 Translators**  
  - Internal engine transforms FHIR Claim resources to X12 837  
  - Incoming 835 to FHIR ExplanationOfBenefit  

### 2.3 Authentication & Security
- **OAuth 2.0 / JWT** for REST calls  
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** for batch file transfers  
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  - Only finance or billing roles can push/pull ACH data  

### 2.4 Error Handling & Monitoring
- **Standardized Error Codes** (e.g., 401, 422, 550)  
- **Retry Logic** for transient network or trading partner errors  
- **Centralized Logging** and alerting via SIEM integration

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Metric                        | Pre-Integration | Post-Integration | Improvement  |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|--------------|
| Average Claim Turnaround Time | 12 days         | 4 days           | –67%         |
| Days in A/R                   | 45 days         | 28 days          | –38%         |
| Claim Denial Rate             | 8%              | 4%               | –50%         |
| Manual Data‐Entry Errors      | 120/month       | 30/month         | –75%         |
| Staff Hours in Reconciliation | 200 hrs/month   | 60 hrs/month     | –70%         |

**Stakeholder Benefits**  
- **Revenue Cycle Managers**: faster cash flow, lower DSO  
- **Billing Staff**: reduced manual work, fewer exceptions  
- **Finance Leadership**: real-time visibility into receivables  
- **Compliance Officers**: robust audit trail, simplified reporting

## 4. Implementation Considerations for RECORDS

1. **Data Governance & Mapping**  
   - Align RECORDS’ chart of accounts and procedure codes with HMS-ACH code sets  
   - Validate field‐level mappings for patient demographics and insurance IDs  

2. **Infrastructure & Security**  
   - Provision dedicated API gateway with TLS certificates  
   - Configure SFTP servers with hardened security policies  

3. **Workflow Alignment**  
   - Update RECORDS’ billing workflows to invoke ACH APIs at point of claim creation  
   - Train staff on new exception dashboards and remediation processes  

4. **Regulatory Compliance**  
   - Ensure Business Associate Agreements (BAA) are in place  
   - Conduct security penetration tests before go-live  

5. **Phased Rollout**  
   - **Phase 1**: Eligibility check and single‐claim submission  
   - **Phase 2**: Batch 837/835 exchange and reconciliation  
   - **Phase 3**: Advanced analytics and custom reporting

## 5. Integration Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Patient Discharge Billing
1. Discharge event triggers RECORDS to generate FHIR Claim.  
2. HMS-ACH API `/ach/submitClaim` is called; returns `claimID`.  
3. RECORDS updates Bill Record with `claimID` and status “Submitted”.  

### Use Case 2: Real-Time Eligibility Check
1. Front-desk staff enters insurance details in RECORDS.  
2. RECORDS calls `/ach/queryEligibility` before service.  
3. HMS-ACH returns coverage limits, co-pay, deductible status; RECORDS displays alert.

### Use Case 3: Automated Remittance Posting
1. Daily SFTP fetch of 835 files from HMS-ACH.  
2. TRANSLATOR engine maps to FHIR ExplanationOfBenefit.  
3. RECORDS ingests and auto-applies payments to open invoices; flags discrepancies.

### Use Case 4: Denial Management Dashboard
1. HMS-ACH pushes denial notifications via webhook.  
2. RECORDS logs denial reason codes and escalates to denials team.  
3. Denials dashboard shows trending reasons, resolution SLA, and recovery actions.

By leveraging HMS-ACH’s robust automated payment and reconciliation capabilities, RECORDS can accelerate its revenue cycle, reduce manual overhead, and gain actionable insights — all while maintaining compliance and data integrity.
