# Chapter 12: Legislative Process Workflow

In [Chapter 11: HMS-CDF (Legislative Engine)](11_hms_cdf__legislative_engine__.md) we saw how bills get stored and moved through basic steps. Now let’s explore the full **10-step Legislative Process Workflow**, the “relay race” that turns an idea into law—accelerated by AI, guarded by democratic deal-flow negotiations.

---

## 1. Why a 10-Step Workflow Matters

Imagine a lawmaker drafting an **Emergency Housing Subsidy**:

1. They write a quick policy draft in HMS-GOV.  
2. AI suggests improvements.  
3. Committee members, interest groups, and staff each need to weigh in.  
4. Votes happen, amendments are merged, conflicts resolved.  
5. Finally, the bill signs into effect and citizen portals update in real time.

Without a clear, enforced sequence, steps get skipped or rushed. Our **Legislative Process Workflow** abstraction codifies each checkpoint—from **Conceptualize** through **Evaluation**—so no stage is missed, yet AI speeds things up. Meanwhile, built-in deal-flow negotiations (mini 5-step consensus rounds) ensure everyone’s voice is heard, preserving democratic principles.

## 2. Key Concepts

1. **10 Steps**  
   We model each stage as a named step.  
   - Conceptualize  
   - Drafting  
   - Committee Review  
   - First Vote  
   - Amendment Phase  
   - Second Vote  
   - Reconciliation  
   - Final Vote  
   - Executive Sign-off  
   - Evaluation  

2. **AI Acceleration**  
   AI agents can draft text, suggest amendments, or summarize feedback instantly—cutting days of manual work to minutes.

3. **Deal-Flow Negotiations**  
   Between certain steps (e.g. votes and amendments), we run a mini “5-step deal flow”: propose, discuss, revise, agree, document. This creates a transparent trail of consensus.

4. **Workflow Service**  
   A backend module that enforces step order, triggers AI tasks, and invokes the deal-flow system for negotiation.

## 3. Using the Workflow Service

Here’s how a simple service kicks off and advances a bill through the 10-step flow.

### 3.1 Define the Steps

```js
// config/legislativeSteps.js
module.exports = [
  'Conceptualize',
  'Drafting',
  'Committee Review',
  'First Vote',
  'Amendment Phase',
  'Second Vote',
  'Reconciliation',
  'Final Vote',
  'Executive Sign-off',
  'Evaluation'
];
```
*This array lists our ordered steps.*

### 3.2 Start a New Bill Workflow

```js
// services/legislativeWorkflow.js
const steps = require('../config/legislativeSteps');
let workflows = {}; // in-memory store

function startWorkflow(billId) {
  workflows[billId] = { current: 0 }; // index of "Conceptualize"
  return { billId, step: steps[0] };
}
```
*We record each bill’s position in `workflows`.*

### 3.3 Advance to the Next Step

```js
// services/legislativeWorkflow.js (continued)
const dealFlow = require('./dealFlow');

async function advanceStep(billId, input) {
  let wf = workflows[billId];
  if (wf.current >= steps.length - 1) throw Error('Workflow completed');
  // Before certain steps, run a deal-flow negotiation
  if (['First Vote','Second Vote'].includes(steps[wf.current + 1])) {
    await dealFlow.runNegotiation(billId, input);
  }
  wf.current += 1;
  return { billId, step: steps[wf.current] };
}

module.exports = { startWorkflow, advanceStep };
```
*We call `dealFlow.runNegotiation` before key voting steps.*

## 4. What Happens Under the Hood?

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant UI as HMS-GOV
  participant WF as WorkflowService
  participant AI as HMS-A2A
  participant DF as DealFlowSystem
  participant CDF as HMS-CDF

  UI->>WF: startWorkflow(bill42)
  WF-->>UI: { step:"Conceptualize" }
  UI->>WF: advanceStep(bill42,{ topic:'rent relief' })
  WF->>AI: generateDraft({ topic })
  AI-->>WF: draftContent
  WF->>CDF: POST /bills (draftContent)
  CDF-->>WF: { billId:42, status:"Drafting" }
  WF-->>UI: { step:"Drafting" }
  ... later ...
  UI->>WF: advanceStep(bill42,{ votes })
  WF->>DF: runNegotiation(bill42, votes)
  DF-->>WF: consensusReached
  WF->>CDF: POST /bills/42/vote
  CDF-->>WF: { step:"Committee Review" }
  WF-->>UI: { step:"Committee Review" }
```

1. **UI** starts or advances a bill.  
2. **WorkflowService** may call **HMS-A2A** for AI drafts.  
3. Drafts go into **HMS-CDF** via its API.  
4. Before votes, **DealFlowSystem** runs mini-negotiations.  
5. Final step updates go back to **HMS-CDF** and **UI**.

---

## 5. Inside the Deal-Flow Negotiation

A simplified deal-flow has 5 rounds:

```js
// services/dealFlow.js
async function runNegotiation(billId, data) {
  // 1. propose
  await saveRound(billId, 'proposal', data);
  // 2. discussion
  await collectFeedback(billId);
  // 3. revise
  await saveRound(billId, 'revision', data);
  // 4. agree
  await collectVotes(billId);
  // 5. document
  await saveRound(billId, 'agreement', { agreed:true });
}
module.exports = { runNegotiation };
```
*This stub shows each mini-step—proposal, feedback, revision, vote, record.*

---

## 6. Conclusion

You’ve learned how the **Legislative Process Workflow** abstraction enforces a ten-stage sequence—automating drafts with AI, then pausing for built-in deal-flow negotiations to preserve consensus. This ensures every bill follows the same democratic checkpoints, from **Conceptualize** through **Evaluation**.

Next up, we’ll expose these completed laws to citizens in [Chapter 13: HMS-MKT (Public Portal)](13_hms_mkt__public_portal__.md).
