# HMS-ACH Integration with 

# Integration of HMS-ACH with CREDIT

This document analyzes how the HMS-ACH (Automated Clearing House) component of the HMS (Hospital Management System) can integrate with and enhance the CREDIT platform. CREDIT’s mission is to streamline patient credit approvals, disbursements, and repayment tracking. HMS-ACH adds real-time payment processing, reconciliation, and reporting capabilities that directly support CREDIT’s goals.

## 1. Key Capabilities of HMS-ACH for CREDIT’s Mission

- Real-Time ACH Processing  
  • Instant initiation of credit disbursements to hospitals or patients via ACH.  
  • Consolidated batch processing for scheduled repayments.

- Automated Reconciliation  
  • Auto-matching of incoming payments against outstanding balances.  
  • Exception handling workflows for failed or returned transactions.

- Detailed Transaction Ledger  
  • Granular audit trail of all debits and credits.  
  • Timestamped, immutable records for compliance and reporting.

- Configurable Business Rules Engine  
  • Threshold-based approvals or holds.  
  • Customizable fees, interest calculations, and repayment schedules.

- Notifications & Alerts  
  • Real-time SMS/email notifications for transaction status (approved, pending, failed).  
  • Dashboard alerts for finance teams on exceptions or high-risk accounts.

## 2. Technical Integration Architecture

### 2.1 API Endpoints & Data Flows
1. **Credit Approval Request**  
   • CREDIT → HMS-ACH POST /api/v1/payments/initiate  
   • Payload: patient_id, hospital_id, amount, credit_reference  
   • Response: transaction_id, status (pending/approved), estimated_time

2. **Payment Status Query**  
   • CREDIT → HMS-ACH GET /api/v1/payments/{transaction_id}/status  
   • Response: status (settled, failed, returned), settlement_date, error_code

3. **Reconciliation Webhook**  
   • HMS-ACH → CREDIT POST /webhooks/reconciliation  
   • Payload: transaction_id, settlement_amount, balance, exceptions[]

4. **Ledger Export**  
   • CREDIT → HMS-ACH GET /api/v1/ledger?from=&to=  
   • Response: CSV/JSON of all transactions within date range

### 2.2 Authentication & Security
- OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow for machine-to-machine authentication  
- Mutual TLS for API transport security  
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for short-lived session validation  
- AES-256 encrypted payloads for PII compliance (HIPAA/PCI DSS)

### 2.3 Data Mapping & Schema
- **PatientID** ↔ internal HMS patient reference  
- **CreditRef** ↔ unique loan account in CREDIT  
- **Amount** (decimal, 2 places) ↔ standardized currency code (ISO 4217)  
- **Status Codes** aligned:  
  • P = Pending  
  • S = Settled  
  • F = Failed  
  • R = Returned

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements for Stakeholders

| Stakeholder      | Benefit                                   | Metric / KPI                                |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Patients         | Faster credit disbursement                | 90% of approvals in <5 minutes              |
| Hospital Finance | Reduced manual reconciliation effort      | 70% fewer manual adjustments per month      |
| CREDIT Operations| Automated exception workflows             | 50% reduction in exception backlog          |
| Compliance Team  | Comprehensive audit trail                 | 100% transaction traceability               |
| IT Department    | Simplified integration & maintenance      | 30% lower support tickets post-go-live      |

## 4. Implementation Considerations Specific to CREDIT

- **Regulatory Compliance**  
  • Ensure ACH processing meets NACHA rules and local banking regulations.  
  • HIPAA-compliant handling of Protected Health Information (PHI).

- **Data Privacy & Consent**  
  • Patient consent capture in CREDIT must map to HMS-ACH data sharing flags.  
  • GDPR/CCPA opt-in mechanisms if handling EU/CA residents.

- **Scalability & Performance**  
  • Indexing on transaction tables to support high throughput (5k+ txn/sec).  
  • Horizontal scaling of API layer behind load balancers.

- **Error Handling & Retry Logic**  
  • Idempotent transaction submission (client-generated GUIDs).  
  • Exponential back-off for transient bank network failures.

- **Change Management**  
  • Phased rollout starting with pilot hospitals.  
  • Staff training on new dashboards and reconciliation processes.

## 5. Use Cases

### 5.1 Urgent Care Credit Pre-Approval
1. Patient arrives at ER; CREDIT requests $1,000 credit pre-approval.  
2. HMS-ACH processes the ACH debit hold; returns immediate “approved” status.  
3. ER admits patient; credit automatically applied to hospital billing system.

### 5.2 Monthly Repayment Reconciliation
1. On the 1st of each month, CREDIT calls HMS-ACH ledger export.  
2. Matched transactions auto-post repayments; exceptions flagged for review.  
3. Finance team closes 95% of accounts without manual intervention.

### 5.3 Failed Transaction Exception Workflow
1. A repayment ACH return due to insufficient funds.  
2. HMS-ACH fires webhook with error_code=R02 (Insufficient Funds).  
3. CREDIT’s business rules engine schedules retry in 5 days and sends customer SMS reminder.

By integrating HMS-ACH’s robust payment processing and reconciliation capabilities, CREDIT will achieve faster credit disbursements, tighter financial controls, and measurable reductions in manual effort and exception rates—directly advancing its mission to streamline patient financing.
