## Real-World Use Case: AI-Facilitated Policy Optimization

### Actors

- Civilians
- Government agencies
- HMS-ACH, HMS-GOV, HMS-MKT, HMS-MFE 

### Preconditions

- The DEVELOPMENT has integrated the HMS-ACH system.

### Main Flow

1. A civilian submits a request via the HMS-GOV platform.
2. The request is processed by the HMS-ACH, which automates various bureaucratic procedures.
3. The HMS-MKT assists in recruiting and training the necessary staff to handle the request.
4. The HMS-MFE manages the budget and resources needed for the request.
5. The solution is implemented and delivered to the civilian.

### Alternative Flows

- In case of technical issues, the request is forwarded to the HMS-ACH support team.

### Postconditions

- The civilian's request has been successfully addressed.
- The government agency has improved its operational efficiency and customer service.
