# Integration of HMS-ACH with the MARITIME Platform

This document analyzes how the HMS-ACH (Health Management System – Ambulatory Care/Hospital) component can integrate with and enhance the MARITIME operational platform. It covers:

1. HMS-ACH capabilities aligned to MARITIME’s mission  
2. Technical integration approach (APIs, data flows, auth)  
3. Stakeholder benefits and metrics  
4. MARITIME-specific implementation considerations  
5. Illustrative use cases

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing MARITIME’s Mission Needs

- **Real-Time Casualty Tracking**  
  • Capture and propagate patient triage status, vital signs, and location (ship, port facility, shore hospital)  
  • Geo-tagged medical events to support rescue and MEDEVAC coordination  

- **Bed & Resource Management**  
  • Dynamic view of bed availability on vessels and shore-side medical facilities  
  • Automated resource scheduling (personnel, stretchers, isolation wards)  

- **Medical Supply Chain & Logistics**  
  • Inventory tracking of pharmaceuticals, consumables, field kits  
  • Automated requisition workflows tied to operational logistics (e.g., re-supply from nearest depot)  

- **Clinical Documentation & Reporting**  
  • HL7 FHIR–compliant electronic health records for continuity of care  
  • Custom reports (infection control, mass-casualty drills, heat-injury statistics)  

- **Analytics & Decision Support**  
  • Dashboards for casualty forecasts, outbreak detection, personnel readiness  
  • Predictive alerts (e.g., rising heat-stress cases among deck crews)

## 2. Technical Integration Architecture

### 2.1 APIs & Data Exchange

- **RESTful Services**  
  • `GET /api/patients/{id}` – retrieve patient record  
  • `POST /api/triage/events` – push new casualty triage events  
  • `PATCH /api/bed-management` – update bed status  

- **Messaging & Event Bus**  
  • Publish/subscribe (Apache Kafka or JMS) for real-time event propagation  
  • Topics: `casualty/triage`, `logistics/supply-req`, `analytics/alerts`

- **Data Formats & Standards**  
  • HL7 FHIR for clinical data (Patient, Observation, Encounter)  
  • JSON-LD or NIEM for logistics and operations metadata  

### 2.2 Authentication & Authorization

- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect**  
  • MARITIME issues JWT access tokens after federated identity brokering  
  • Role-based scopes (e.g., `medevac:read`, `inventory:write`)  

- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)**  
  • Ensures end-to-end encryption and mutual endpoint verification, especially over SATCOM  

- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**  
  • Fine-grained policies (e.g., only shipboard medical officers can update triage severity)  

### 2.3 Deployment & Infrastructure

- **Edge Containers on Vessels**  
  • HMS-ACH microservices containerized (Docker/K8s) with offline-first caches  
  • Data sync agents handle bandwidth-constrained pushes to shore  

- **Shore-Side Cloud or On-Prem**  
  • Scalable cloud node (or DoD IL4 enclave) hosting central patient registry and dashboards  
  • High-availability clustered databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB)

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Stakeholder              | Benefit                                    | KPI / Metric                        |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Operations Command       | Enhanced casualty situational awareness    | Time from injury to triage ↓ 30%    |
| Medical Staff (Ship/Shore)| Smarter resource allocation                | Bed utilization efficiency ↑ 25%    |
| Logistics & Supply Chain | Automated requisitions reduce stock-outs   | Inventory turn rate ↓ 40%           |
| Executive Leadership     | Data-driven readiness reporting            | Reporting latency ↓ 50%             |
| Crewmembers & Patients   | Faster, safer medical response             | MEDEVAC dispatch time ↓ 35%         |

- **Operational Resilience**  
  • Fewer manual handoffs, reduced paperwork errors  
- **Cost Avoidance**  
  • Optimized inventory levels prevent over-ordering  
- **Regulatory Compliance**  
  • Built-in audit trails for medical and logistics events

## 4. MARITIME-Specific Implementation Considerations

- **Intermittent Connectivity**  
  • Design for high latency / disconnected sync modes  
  • Delta-sync algorithms to minimize bandwidth  

- **Shipboard IT Constraints**  
  • Limited rack-space for servers → prefer micro-VM or ARM edge nodes  
  • Integration with existing bridge and combat system LANs (security zones)  

- **Security & Accreditation**  
  • IL-4/CUI data handling: FIPS 140-2 encryption, DoD STIG compliance  
  • Regular vulnerability scanning, strict network segmentation  

- **User Training & Change Management**  
  • Medical and deck crews require quick-start guides for HMS-ACH-MARITIME workflows  
  • Simulation drills to validate MEDEVAC and mass-casualty playbooks  

- **Interoperability with Coalition Partners**  
  • Support NATO STANAG messaging for allied exercises and joint ops  
  • Multi-tenant data partitioning for partner sovereignty

## 5. Sample Use Cases

### A. Collision Casualty Response

1. **Event Capture**  
   • Ship A reports “multiple deck injuries” via HMS-ACH triage app  
2. **Automated Data Push**  
   • Triaged data published to MARITIME event bus  
3. **Command & Control**  
   • Ops center dashboard highlights casualty hot-spot; MEDEVAC request auto-populates  
4. **Logistics Fulfillment**  
   • Nearest supply vessel pushes first-aid kits; arrival ETA aligns with medevac  
5. **After-Action Reporting**  
   • Incident data flows back to MARITIME’s analytics module for lessons learned  

### B. Outbreak Management on Deployment

1. **Symptom Reporting**  
   • Crew members log fever/cough in HMS-ACH mobile app  
2. **Cluster Detection**  
   • MARITIME analytics flags abnormal spike → infection control alert  
3. **Resource Allocation**  
   • Automated reservation of isolation bunks; PPE requisition triggered  
4. **Telemedicine Link**  
   • Shore-side specialists gain HL7 FHIR access to patient Observations  
5. **Containment Metrics**  
   • R₀ computed and displayed; response timeline measured for continuous improvement  

### C. Joint Exercise with Allied Navies

1. **Data Exchange Setup**  
   • Configure multi-tenant partitions and STANAG-compliant transformation  
2. **Shared Triaging**  
   • Coalition ships feed HMS-ACH events into MARITIME; allied medics view consolidated feed  
3. **Cross-Deck Patient Transfer**  
   • Real-time bed availability across coalition ports directs casualty flow  
4. **Unified After-Action Review**  
   • Combined exercise data ingested into MARITIME’s AAR engine for unified reporting
