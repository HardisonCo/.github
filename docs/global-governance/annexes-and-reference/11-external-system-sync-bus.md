# Chapter 11: External System Sync Bus  
*(The always-on conveyor belt between HMS and every legacy tool in the building)*  

[‚Üê Back to ‚ÄúCompliance Reasoner (HMS-ESQ)‚Äù](10_compliance_reasoner__hms_esq__.md)

## 1. Why Bother With a ‚ÄúSync Bus‚Äù? ‚Äì A One-Minute Story  

At **3 PM** the *Compliance Reasoner* clears a new emission-testing rule for the **Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)**.  
Yet the DMV still runs a **COBOL** batch job every night at **11 PM** on a mainframe.  
If that job does **not** contain the fresh rule set, tomorrow‚Äôs inspection stickers will be printed with yesterday‚Äôs standards‚Äîcitizens get fined unfairly and reporters have a field day.

The **External System Sync Bus (simply ‚Äúthe Bus‚Äù)** is a **24 √ó 7 conveyor belt** that:

1. **Pushes** policy updates out of HMS the second they are approved.  
2. **Pulls** metrics or status files **back in** from those aging schedulers, SaaS tools, or mainframes.  
3. Guarantees ‚Äúexactly-once‚Äù delivery so no system sees half-finished rules.  

Think of it as the **inter-office mail cart** that never stops rolling.

## 2. Beginner Glossary  

| Term             | Plain-English Meaning                            | Emoji |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------|
| **Connector**    | A plug that speaks one legacy protocol (FTP, CSV, SOAP‚Ä¶) | üîå |
| **Channel / Topic** | Named lane on the conveyor belt (e.g., `DMV_RULES`) | üì¨ |
| **Envelope**     | Tiny JSON wrapper holding the real payload plus metadata (`program_id`, `revision`) | ‚úâÔ∏è |
| **Publisher**    | Service that **puts** envelopes on a channel     | üì§ |
| **Subscriber**   | Script or legacy app that **grabs** envelopes    | üì• |
| **Ack**          | ‚ÄúGot it!‚Äù message‚Äîprevents duplicates           | ‚úÖ |

If you can send a parcel and wait for a signed return card, you already understand the Bus.

## 3. The Core Use Case ‚Äì DMV Nightly Job  

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant HMS as HMS-API
    participant BUS as Sync Bus
    participant DMV as DMV Mainframe
    HMS->>BUS: PUBLISH  {protocol: Emission v5}
    DMV-->>BUS: SUBSCRIBE DMV_RULES
    BUS-->>DMV: Emission v5  (exactly-once)
    DMV->>BUS: ACK  (stored)
```

Result: when the mainframe wakes up at 23:00 it already owns **Emission v5**‚Äîno manual SFTP, no panic calls.

---

## 4. Publishing Your First Envelope (14 Lines)

```php
use HMS\Bus\Publisher;
use App\Models\Core\Protocol\Protocol;

// 1. Load the freshly-approved protocol
$proto = Protocol::latest('emission_testing');

// 2. Wrap it in an envelope
$env = [
    'channel'     => 'DMV_RULES',
    'program_id'  => $proto->program_id,
    'revision'    => $proto->revision,
    'payload'     => $proto->toJson(),
];

// 3. Drop it on the Bus
Publisher::to('kafka://bus:9092')->send($env);
```

Explanation  
1. `latest()` fetches the newest cleared rule.  
2. The envelope adds routing & version info.  
3. `send()` is protocol-agnostic; today it‚Äôs Kafka, tomorrow maybe NATS.

---

## 5. Consuming From a Legacy Cron (17 Lines, Bash)

Imagine the DMV only speaks **FTP + shell**:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# nightly_emission_pull.sh
CHANNEL="DMV_RULES"
DEST="/opt/mainframe/rules/emission.json"

# 1. Poll the Bus REST shim (simplest demo)
curl -s "http://bus:8080/pop/$CHANNEL" -o /tmp/incoming.json

# 2. Exit if nothing new
[ ! -s /tmp/incoming.json ] && exit 0

# 3. Move file where COBOL expects it
mv /tmp/incoming.json "$DEST"

# 4. Ack so message disappears from the queue
MSG_ID=$(jq -r '.id' "$DEST")
curl -X POST "http://bus:8080/ack/$MSG_ID"
```

Even a 1990s mainframe can run a cron job like that‚Äîmission accomplished.

## 6. What Happens Under the Hood? (Five-Step Walkthrough)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Publisher] -->|1. produce| B(Kafka Topic<br/>DMV_RULES)
    B -->|2. durable store| C[Message Log]
    D[Legacy Consumer] -->|3. poll / pop| B
    B -->|4. hand off payload| D
    D -->|5. ack| B -->|delete or mark done| C
```

Key points  
1. The payload is written **once** to the topic.  
2. The Bus keeps it until the consumer sends a proper **Ack**.  
3. If the consumer crashes, the envelope stays safe and will be redelivered.

## 7. A Tiny Peek Into the Code (‚â§ 18 Lines Each)

### 7.1  Envelope POJO ‚Äì `app/Bus/Envelope.php`

```php
class Envelope
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $channel,
        public int    $program_id,
        public int    $revision,
        public string $payload,
        public string $id = '',
    ) {
        $this->id = $this->id ?: uniqid('bus_', true);
    }

    public function toJson(): string
    {
        return json_encode(get_object_vars($this));
    }
}
```

Simple data bag‚Äîonly five properties plus an auto-generated ID.

---

### 7.2  Minimal Publisher ‚Äì `app/Bus/Publisher.php`

```php
class Publisher
{
    public static function to(string $broker): self
    {
        return new self($broker);
    }

    public function __construct(private string $broker) {}

    public function send(array $env)
    {
        // delegate to chosen driver (Kafka here)
        $msg = new RdKafka\Message($env['channel'], 0, json_encode($env));
        $producer = new RdKafka\Producer(['metadata.broker.list' => $this->broker]);
        $producer->produce($msg);
        $producer->flush(1000);  // ms
    }
}
```

Beginners note: `RdKafka` is a thin PHP extension‚Äîyou only need two method calls.

## 8. Hands-On Exercise (15 min)

1. **Spin up demo stack**

```bash
docker compose -f demo/compose-bus.yml up -d
```

(Starts Kafka + a REST shim at `localhost:8080`.)

2. **Publish a test envelope**

```bash
php artisan tinker
>>> Publisher::to('localhost:9092')->send([
... 'channel'=>'TEST',
... 'program_id'=>999,
... 'revision'=>1,
... 'payload'=>'{"hello":"world"}',
... ]);
```

3. **Consume**

```bash
curl localhost:8080/pop/TEST
# ‚Üí JSON payload appears
```

4. **Ack**

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/ack/<ID_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP>
```

5. Repeat the `pop`‚Äîqueue is now empty.  
You have just run a full publish ‚Üí consume ‚Üí acknowledge cycle!

## 9. How the Bus Touches Other Chapters

| Task | Which Chapter Provides the Data | Link |
|------|---------------------------------|------|
| Gets freshly cleared protocols | Compliance Reasoner | [Compliance Reasoner](10_compliance_reasoner__hms_esq__.md) |
| Uses Program IDs for routing  | Program Registry | [Program Registry](01_program_registry__program_model__.md) |
| Emits retry / failure metrics | Operations & Monitoring Layer | [Operations & Monitoring Layer](16_operations___monitoring_layer__hms_ops__.md) |
| Feeds aggregated metrics back  | Central Data Lake | [Central Data Lake](15_central_data_lake__hms_dta__.md) |

## 10. Government Analogy Cheat-Sheet

| Real Object | Sync Bus Equivalent |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Inter-office mail cart | The Bus itself |
| Manila envelope | JSON envelope |
| Department mail slot (‚ÄúFinance‚Äù, ‚ÄúDMV‚Äù) | Channel / Topic |
| Signed delivery receipt | Ack |
| Lost mail search | Retry / redelivery logic |

## 11. What You Learned

‚úî Why a **continuous Sync Bus** is vital for agencies running mainframes, SaaS, or cron jobs.  
‚úî How to **publish** and **consume** envelopes in under 20 lines of code.  
‚úî The behind-the-scenes **exactly-once** dance (store ‚Üí pop ‚Üí ack).  
‚úî How the Bus meshes with earlier pieces like the **Compliance Reasoner** and **Operations Layer**.

Ready to see how multiple **agencies talk to each other**‚Äînot just to their own legacy tools?
