# HMS-ACH Integration with 

# Integration of HMS-ACH with Insurance Systems

This document outlines how the HMS-ACH (Automated Clearinghouse) component of the Hospital Management System (HMS) can integrate with insurance partners to streamline claims processing, payment reconciliation, and data exchange.

## 1. Specific HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing Insurance Needs

- **Automated Claim Submission**  
  - Formats outpatient/inpatient claims into ANSI X12 837 or HL7 FHIR Claim resources  
  - Batches and transmits claims on user-defined schedules  
- **Eligibility & Benefits Verification**  
  - Real-time eligibility checks via X12 270/271 or FHIR Patient/EligibilityRequests  
  - Returns co-pay, deductible, and coverage details prior to service  
- **Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) Processing**  
  - Ingests X12 835 or FHIR ExplanationOfBenefit response files  
  - Automatically applies payments and adjustments to patient accounts  
- **Exception & Denial Management**  
  - Flags denied or pended claims  
  - Routes exceptions into a workflow queue for follow-up and appeals  
- **Reconciliation & Reporting**  
  - Matches posted ERAs against submitted claims  
  - Generates dashboards for days-in-AR, denial rates, and cash pacing

## 2. Technical Integration

### 2.1 APIs & Data Flows

1. **Claims Submission**  
   - HMS-ACH exposes a RESTful endpoint (`/api/claims/submit`)  
   - Payload: JSON or EDI 837  
   - Insurance partner returns synchronous ACK/NACK or asynchronous 997  
2. **Eligibility Checks**  
   - HMS-ACH invokes insurer’s X12 270/271 endpoint or FHIR Eligibility API  
   - Parses response and updates HMS patient account in real time  
3. **Electronic Remittance Advice**  
   - Insurance forwards 835 ERA files to HMS-ACH via SFTP or REST callback (`/api/era/upload`)  
   - HMS-ACH parses payments, posts transactions, and generates lockboxes  
4. **Denial Management**  
   - Denials from insurer (837/271 or FHIR `ExplanationOfBenefit.status = “error”`)  
   - Trigger JMS/RabbitMQ event to HMS-CaseManagement for appeals routing  

### 2.2 Authentication & Security

- **OAuth 2.0 / JWT** for REST API calls  
- **MTLS** (Mutual TLS) for SFTP or EDI gateways  
- **HIPAA-Compliant Encryption** at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+)  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** within HMS to restrict sensitive insurance operations

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Stakeholder           | Benefit                                       | Metric                          |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Finance / Revenue Cycle | Faster cash flow                             | ↓ Days in A/R by 20–30%         |
| Billing Team          | Reduced manual data entry & errors            | ↓ Claim rejections by 15%       |
| IT / Compliance       | Standardized, auditable data exchange         | 100% audit trail coverage       |
| Patients              | Fewer surprise bills, clearer pre-estimate    | ↑ Patient satisfaction scores   |
| Insurance Partners    | Streamlined claim adjudication, fewer inquiries | ↓ Inquiry volume by 25%         |

## 4. Implementation Considerations for Insurance

- **Standards Alignment**  
  - Select EDI X12 version (e.g., 4010 vs. 5010) or FHIR R4 IG for claims/ERAs  
- **Connectivity & Onboarding**  
  - Establish trading partner agreements (TPAs)  
  - Exchange digital certificates for MTLS or SFTP keys  
- **Data Mapping & Transformation**  
  - Map HMS internal service codes to insurer-specific plans/procedures  
  - Configure transformation templates (e.g., MuleSoft, BizTalk, or in-house ETL)  
- **Testing & Certification**  
  - Conduct end-to-end test cycles: connectivity, 837 test files, 835 acknowledgments  
  - Achieve production certification with each insurer  
- **Change Management**  
  - Train billing staff on new dashboards and exception workflows  
  - Update SOPs for claims submission and denial resolution

## 5. Use Cases

### 5.1 Real-Time Eligibility Check at Registration  
1. Patient checks in.  
2. HMS-ACH sends X12 270 to insurer.  
3. Insurer returns coverage, deductible balance via 271.  
4. HMS front-desk prints a pre-authorization estimate.  

### 5.2 Automated Claim Submission & Reconciliation  
1. Overnight batch exports all finalized charges as EDI 837.  
2. Insurer ACKs 997 the next morning.  
3. Five days later, insurer deposits payment via 835.  
4. HMS-ACH ingests 835, auto-posts payments and adjustments.  
5. Unmatched line items generate tasks for billing follow-up.  

### 5.3 Denial Management & Appeals Workflow  
1. Insurer denies service (code 22 – no prior auth) in 835.  
2. HMS-ACH flags the claim, routes it to denial-management queue.  
3. Billing specialist reviews, obtains pre-auth, re-submits corrected claim.
