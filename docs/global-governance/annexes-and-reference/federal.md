# HMS-ACH Integration with 

# Integrating HMS-ACH with the Federal Health Agency (FHA)

This document outlines how the HMS-ACH (Hospital Management System – Admission/Discharge/Transfer & Care Hub) component can integrate with and benefit a generic federal health authority (“FHA”). It covers:  
1. Key HMS-ACH capabilities aligned to FHA mission  
2. Technical integration architecture  
3. Stakeholder benefits and metrics  
4. Federal-specific implementation considerations  
5. Illustrative use cases

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing FHA Mission Needs

- **Real-Time Patient Lifecycle Management**  
  • Automated Admission, Discharge, Transfer (ADT) workflows  
  • Bed-tracking dashboard with occupancy forecasting  
  • Alerts for transfer delays, off-hour admissions, no-shows  

- **Interagency Data Exchange & Reporting**  
  • Native support for HL7 v2.x, FHIR R4 resource sets  
  • Pre-built exports for CMS, CDC, FEMA situational reporting  
  • Role-based dashboards for public-health surveillance  

- **Care Coordination & Telehealth**  
  • Integrated care plans, orders, and remote-monitoring device feeds  
  • Secure video and messaging modules for tele-consultations  
  • Automated referrals to VA, DoD, and civilian specialists  

- **Security & Compliance**  
  • FISMA Moderate authorization-ready (NIST SP 800-53 controls)  
  • HIPAA, 42 CFR Part 2, and FedRAMP Low baseline  
  • Data encryption at-rest (AES-256) and in-transit (TLS 1.2+), audit trails

## 2. Technical Integration Architecture

### 2.1 API & Data Flows  
- **RESTful / FHIR API Layer**  
  • Exposes Patient, Encounter, Location, Observation resources  
  • Supports JSON/XML payloads, bulk data (FHIR Bulk FHIR)  
- **HL7 v2.x Interface Engine**  
  • MLLP endpoints for legacy ADT feeds  
  • Transforms and routes into FHIR-native canonical model  
- **Secure File Exchanges**  
  • SFTP drop for large batch exports (e.g., nightly census)  
  • Automated checksum and delivery confirmation  

### 2.2 Authentication & Authorization  
- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect** for user and service-to-service flows  
- **JWT tokens** with scopes aligned to FHA roles  
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** for backend API calls between FHA systems and HMS-ACH  
- **Centralized Identity Hub** integration (e.g., PIV/CAC, ADFS)  

### 2.3 Architecture Deployment  
- **Hybrid Cloud Model**  
  • On-premises appliances for classified data processing  
  • FedRAMP-authorized SaaS tier for analytics, reporting  
- **Event Bus / Message Queue** (Kafka, ActiveMQ) for near real-time updates  
- **Data Lake / Analytics Cluster** (AWS GovCloud/Sovereign) for BI

## 3. Stakeholder Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Stakeholder           | Benefit                                       | Measurable Improvement                  |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Patients              | Faster admissions & discharges                | ↓ Average ED-to-bed time by 30%         |
| Clinicians            | Unified patient view, fewer duplicate orders  | ↓ Charting time by 25%, ↓ errors by 40% |
| Administrators        | Real-time capacity/utilization dashboards     | ↑ Bed utilization by 15%                |
| Public-Health Leads   | Automated reporting to CDC/FEMA               | ↑ Reporting timeliness to 100% SLA      |
| IT & Security Teams   | FedRAMP-ready platform with built-in controls | ↓ Audit findings, faster ATO process    |

## 4. Federal-Specific Implementation Considerations

- **Compliance & Authorization**  
  • Achieve FISMA Moderate / FedRAMP Low ATO  
  • Map system controls to NIST 800-53 Rev. 5  
- **Data Classification & Residency**  
  • Segregate Privacy Act data (PII/PHI) in dedicated enclaves  
  • Ensure CJIS-equivalent handling if law-enforcement data co-mingled  
- **Procurement & Contracting**  
  • Leverage GSA Schedule 70 / VA T4NG vehicles  
  • Align SOW with FAR Clause 52.204-21 (Basic Safeguarding)  
- **Interoperability Governance**  
  • Join federal Health Information Exchanges (HIEs)  
  • Conform to TEFCA requirements for nationwide data sharing  
- **Training & Change Management**  
  • Role-based training modules (instructor-led + eLearning)  
  • Phased rollout: pilot in one region → incremental national scale

## 5. Use Cases in Action

### 5.1 Hurricane Response & Surge Management  
- **Scenario**: Rapid triage and transfer of evacuees to federal and civilian hospitals  
- **Flow**:  
  1. Field ADT entries via mobile app → HMS-ACH  
  2. Real-time bed availability shared with FEMA dashboard  
  3. Automatic patient record provisioning in receiving facilities  
- **Outcome**: 50% reduction in manual coordination calls; accurate situational awareness  

### 5.2 Interagency Veteran Care Coordination  
- **Scenario**: Seamless transfer of veteran from a civilian hospital to VA medical center  
- **Flow**:  
  1. Civilian HMS-ACH system flags veteran status (via DMDC lookup)  
  2. Electronic care record and transfer summary pushed via FHIR to VA’s VistA/CPRS  
  3. Telehealth appointment scheduled automatically with VA specialist  
- **Outcome**: 2-day reduction in transfer delays; improved continuity of care  

### 5.3 Pandemic Surveillance & Reporting  
- **Scenario**: Aggregate daily census, ICU utilization, ventilator use across all federal facilities  
- **Flow**:  
  1. HMS-ACH publishes nightly bulk FHIR Bulk Data to the FHA Data Lake  
  2. Automated ETL feeds CDC’s COVID Data Tracker API  
  3. Dashboards update within 2 hours of data receipt  
- **Outcome**: 100% on-time federal reporting; data-driven allocation of resources
