# HMS-ACH Integration with 

# Integration of HMS-ACH with WASTE

This document outlines how the HMS-ACH (Health & Maintenance System – Advanced Component Hub) can integrate with the WASTE (Warfighter Analytics & Simulation Training Environment) to meet mission-critical needs, improve data flows, and deliver measurable benefits.

---

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing WASTE Mission Needs

- **Real‐Time Health Monitoring**  
  • Continuous telemetry feed of platform/component health (temperatures, voltages, component lifetimes)  
  • Dashboards with drill-down to individual component status  

- **Predictive Maintenance & Anomaly Detection**  
  • Machine‐learning models that forecast failure windows based on historical and live data  
  • Automated alerts for out-of-bounds readings or anomalous trends  

- **Configuration & Lifecycle Management**  
  • Centralized repository of firmware/software versions, calibration data, and end-of-life schedules  
  • Change‐control workflows integrated into training scenarios  

- **Standardized Data Models & Interoperability**  
  • Adherence to NATO MSG-085 and IEEE 1451 TEDS standards for sensor metadata  
  • Open interfaces (REST, MQTT) with common JSON/XML payloads  

- **Role-Based Access & Audit Trail**  
  • Fine‐grained user permissions (engineers, instructors, analysts)  
  • Full audit logs for cybersecurity and compliance

## 2. Technical Integration

### 2.1 API & Messaging Interfaces
- **RESTful API**  
  • Endpoints for health‐status queries (`GET /v1/status/{unitID}`)  
  • Maintenance‐task CRUD (`POST /v1/maintenance`, `PUT /v1/maintenance/{id}`)  
- **Event‐Driven Streams**  
  • MQTT topics for high‐frequency sensor updates (`hmsach/units/{unitID}/telemetry`)  
  • Kafka/JMS integration for bulk import/export of historical logs  

### 2.2 Data Flows
1. **Initialization**  
   • WASTE calls HMS-ACH `GET /v1/config/schema` to fetch data definitions.  
2. **Runtime Telemetry**  
   • HMS-ACH publishes live sensor streams to WASTE via MQTT.  
   • WASTE subscribes to relevant topics and ingests into the simulation analytics engine.  
3. **Prediction & Alerts**  
   • HMS-ACH runs ML pipelines and pushes “predicted‐failure” messages to a Kafka topic.  
   • WASTE listens, triggers scenario adjustments or real‐world maintenance tasks.  
4. **Post‐Scenario Reporting**  
   • Upon scenario completion, WASTE invokes `POST /v1/reports` on HMS-ACH, archiving logs and updated health summaries.  

### 2.3 Authentication & Security
- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect**  
  • WASTE obtains JWT tokens via client‐credentials flow.  
  • HMS-ACH validates scopes (`telemetry:read`, `maintenance:write`).  
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)**  
  • Enforced on all inter‐service connections for network‐level authenticity.  
- **Role‐Based Access Control**  
  • HMS-ACH side enforces roles (trainer, technician, admin).  
- **Encryption**  
  • All PII or sensitive data stored/encrypted at rest (AES-256).  
  • TLS 1.2+ in transit.

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Stakeholder           | Benefit                                    | KPI / Metric                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Instructors           | Higher-fidelity training with real health data | Scenario realism score (+25%)                |
| Maintenance Crews     | Proactive scheduling → fewer emergency fixes | Unscheduled downtime ↓ by 40%                |
| Operations Planners   | Better resource allocation                 | Parts usage forecasting accuracy ↑ 30%       |
| Program Managers      | Data-driven readiness reporting            | Mean‐Time-Between‐Failures (MTBF) ↑ by 20%   |
| Cybersecurity Teams   | Centralized audit & compliance             | Audit finding reductions (SOF, DISA, NIST)    |

## 4. WASTE-Specific Implementation Considerations

- **Edge/Offline Scenarios**  
  • Deploy lightweight HMS-ACH Edge Agent within simulator network for intermittent connectivity.  
- **Data Volume & Retention**  
  • Define rolling-window retention (e.g., 90 days of raw telemetry) and archival policies.  
- **Version Compatibility**  
  • HMS-ACH API versioning (v1, v2) to match WASTE release cycles.  
- **Simulation Synchronization**  
  • Time‐sync protocols (PTP/NTP) to align HMS-ACH timestamps with WASTE scenarios.  
- **Sandbox & Certification**  
  • Establish a joint test environment for full end-to-end validation before production rollout.

## 5. Use Cases

### 5.1 Pre-Flight Health Check in Training Exercise
- **Flow**  
  1. WASTE triggers HMS-ACH health‐check API.  
  2. HMS-ACH returns “go/no‐go” status for each subsystem.  
  3. Trainee brief highlights any “red” or “yellow” warnings before take-off.  
- **Benefit**  
  • Mirrors actual pre-flight ops; catch anomalies pre-scenario.  

### 5.2 Live Fault Injection & Response
- **Flow**  
  1. Instructor issues a simulated “hydraulic leak” via HMS-ACH’s scenario API.  
  2. HMS-ACH degrades related telemetry streams in real time.  
  3. WASTE analytics detect the fault, challenge trainee to diagnose and mitigate.  
- **Benefit**  
  • Dynamic, controlled fault training without impacting real hardware.  

### 5.3 Post-Scenario Maintenance Planning
- **Flow**  
  1. Upon scenario end, WASTE quantifies component stress cycles.  
  2. WASTE calls HMS-ACH to schedule conditional maintenance tasks.  
  3. HMS-ACH updates its CMMS (computerized maintenance management system) and notifies crews.  
- **Benefit**  
  • Seamless transition from training to maintenance; reduces administrative hand-offs.

By leveraging HMS-ACH’s robust health monitoring, predictive analytics, and open interfaces, WASTE can significantly elevate training realism, reduce unplanned maintenance, and deliver quantifiable readiness improvements across all stakeholder groups.
