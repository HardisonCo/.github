# Chapter 11: AI Representative Agent
*(builds on [Chapter 10: Identity, Access & Authorization](10_identity__access___authorization_.md))*  

---

## 1. Why do we need an “AI Representative Agent”?

Picture the **Small Business Administration (SBA)** processing thousands of *Recovery Grant* applications every month.  
Citizens keep writing in:

* “The form is confusing.”  
* “Approval takes too long.”  
* “Why can’t I track my application?”

Normally these pain-points sit in an e-mail box until a busy analyst finds time.  
Meanwhile:

* Errors pile up in [HMS-OPS](01_operations___monitoring_hub__hms_ops__.md) logs.  
* Citizens lose trust.

**The AI Representative Agent (AIRA)** is a tireless junior analyst that:

1. Reads live logs & citizen complaints.  
2. Spots repeated friction (“form field X causes 18 % of errors”).  
3. Drafts a *policy patch* (e.g., “make field X optional”).  
4. Opens a pull-request in the rulebook ([HMS-CDF](03_policy_engine___hms_cdf__codified_democracy_foundation__.md)).  
5. Waits for humans to review—never self-merges (guardrails!).

Result: better services, faster, without burning out real staff.

## 2. Key Concepts (Beginner Friendly)

| Term | Think of it as… | Why it matters |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Sensor** | The agent’s ears | Stream of data it listens to (logs, complaints). |
| **Insight** | Sticky note | “This field triggers many 400 errors.” |
| **Proposal** | Draft memo | Suggested change to policy or process. |
| **Pull-Request (PR)** | Envelope to the rulebook | Formal request in HMS-CDF waiting for review. |
| **Guardrail** | Safety rails | Rules that stop the agent from merging or accessing forbidden data. |

Remember these five words; they frame everything AIRA does.

## 3. Quick-Start: Let AIRA fix a confusing form field

Goal: if ≥ 15 % of *Business Size* entries are invalid in one day, AIRA will propose to make the field optional.

### 3.1  Define the agent (YAML, 18 lines)

```yaml
# agents/aira_sba.yaml
id: AIRA_SBA_V1
description: "SBA grant form watchdog"
sensors:
  - type: log
    source: hms-ops://grant-form/errors
    filter: code==400 AND field=="business_size"
threshold:
  pct_errors: 15          # %
time_window: 24h
action:
  type: policy_proposal
  target_rulebook: SBA_FORM_RULES
  template: templates/optional_business_size.md
permissions:
  - logs.read
  - cdf.propose
  - notify.slack
```

Explanation  
• **sensors** tell AIRA where to listen.  
• **threshold** defines when to act.  
• **action** points to a markdown template that will become the pull-request body.  
• **permissions** are checked by the IAA layer—no permission, no action.

### 3.2  The tiny agent runner (Python, 17 lines)

```python
# file: run_agent.py
from hms_agt import AgentRunner      # thin wrapper; see Ch-12
runner = AgentRunner("agents/aira_sba.yaml")
runner.loop_forever()
```

What happens  
1. Runner authenticates as a *service account* (`sub:"service:AIRA_SBA_V1"`).  
2. Subscribes to the error log stream.  
3. Every hour it computes `%errors`.  
4. When ≥ 15 %, it fills in the template and calls `cdf.propose()`.

### 3.3  A sample template (13 lines)

```markdown
# Make "Business Size" optional

## Why
`{{pct_errors}} %` of submissions failed yesterday because the
*Business Size* field is unclear for sole proprietors.

## Change
```diff
-  "business_size": { "required": true }
+  "business_size": { "required": false }
```

_This PR was auto-generated by **AIRA_SBA_V1**._
```

> The curly braces are replaced by live data (e.g., `18.2 %`).

### 3.4  What you’ll see in the rulebook

```text
Proposal PR-417 opened by service:AIRA_SBA_V1
Title: Make "Business Size" optional
Status: PENDING_REVIEW  👀
```

A Slack notification tags the human **Grant Policy Committee** to review.  
Because of guardrails, *only* humans with the `PolicyCommittee` role can merge.

## 4. Step-by-Step Under the Hood

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant OPS as HMS-OPS Logs
  participant AIRA as AI Rep Agent
  participant CDF as HMS-CDF
  participant OFF as Human Official
  OPS-->>AIRA: stream error logs
  AIRA->>AIRA: compute %errors
  AIRA--)AIRA: crosses 15 %
  AIRA->>CDF: open pull-request
  CDF--)OFF: notify for review
  OFF-->>CDF: approve / reject
```

Plain English:  
1. OPS sends log lines; AIRA computes stats.  
2. Threshold met → PR created.  
3. Humans stay in the loop; AIRA cannot self-merge.

---

## 5. A Peek at the Code

### 5.1  Metric calculation (9 lines)

```python
def pct_error(records):
    bad = sum(1 for r in records if r["code"] == 400)
    total = len(records)
    return 0 if total == 0 else round(100 * bad / total, 1)
```

Simple math—kept readable for policy analysts who might tweak it.

### 5.2  Guardrail check (12 lines)

```python
def guardrails_ok(pct):
    MAX_CHANGE = 30    # cannot change a rule affecting >30% users
    return pct < MAX_CHANGE
```

If the suggestion would impact too many users, AIRA abstains and pings a human instead.

### 5.3  Submit PR (simplified, 18 lines)

```python
def submit_pr(text):
    from hms_cdf import CDFClient
    cdf = CDFClient(user="service:AIRA_SBA_V1")
    cdf.propose(
        title="Make \"Business Size\" optional",
        text=text,
        tags=["AUTO_GENERATED", "FORM_FRICTION"]
    )
```

Notice the service account—issued via [Identity, Access & Authorization](10_identity__access___authorization_.md).

## 6. Safety & Ethics Guardrails

AIRA’s power is **constrained** by:

1. **Permissions** – defined in its YAML and enforced by IAA.  
2. **Policy Engine** – any PR must still pass [HMS-ESQ](04_compliance___legal_reasoner__hms_esq__.md) legal checks.  
3. **Human Approval** – merging requires a real person’s vote.  
4. **Change Caps** – agent cannot edit rules touching > 30 % of users (configurable).

These four levers ensure helpful automation **without giving the keys to the kingdom**.

---

## 7. Beginner FAQ

**Q: Can AIRA change code too?**  
Only through a PR in the policy repo. Deployment needs human merge + CI. No direct push.

**Q: What models run AIRA’s language features?**  
Default is a small on-prem LLM via [Model Context Protocol (HMS-MCP)](14_model_context_protocol__hms_mcp__.md). Swap-in models are pluggable.

**Q: How do we stop hallucinated proposals?**  
Set `confidence_min: 0.85` in YAML; AIRA only proposes when the model’s self-score ≥ 85 %.

**Q: Can citizens see agent proposals?**  
Yes. Proposals include an *auto-generated* label and appear in the public policy ledger mirror.

## 8. Recap & What’s Next

You have:

1. Met the **AI Representative Agent**—your never-sleeping junior analyst.  
2. Configured it to watch logs, spot friction, and draft a policy PR.  
3. Seen the guardrails that keep humans firmly in control.  
4. Peeked at the minimal code powering metrics, guardrails, and PR submission.

In the next chapter we’ll open the hood further and look at the **generic runtime** that powers *all* agents—AIRA included.
