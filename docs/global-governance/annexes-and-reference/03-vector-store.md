# Chapter 3: Vector Store

In the previous chapter, [Retrieval](02_retrieval_.md), we learned how our chatbot quickly finds relevant information.  But how is that information organized so it can be searched efficiently?  That's where the *Vector Store* comes in.

Imagine you're searching for information about "LLMs" in the LangChain documentation.  You don't want to read the entire documentation; you just want the relevant parts. The Vector Store helps us do this.

## What is a Vector Store?

A Vector Store is a special kind of database that stores information as vectors.  Think of it like a library where books (documents) are organized not by genre, but by their meaning.  Each book is represented by a "meaning vector" (a list of numbers that captures the essence of the book's content).  When you ask a question, the Vector Store finds the "books" with the closest meaning vectors, providing relevant context.

## How does a Vector Store work?

Let's break down how the Vector Store works with a simple example:

1. **Documents to Vectors:** Each piece of information (like a paragraph from the LangChain documentation) is converted into a meaning vector using [Embeddings](04_embeddings_.md).  This is like assigning each book in our library a unique code based on its meaning.

2. **Storing Vectors:** These meaning vectors, along with the original text, are stored in the Vector Store.  This is like putting the books on shelves based on their codes, not their genres.

3. **Searching the Vector Store:**  When you ask a question, it's also converted into a meaning vector. The Vector Store then finds the vectors that are closest to your question's vector. This is like finding books with similar codes to your query.

4. **Returning Documents:** The original text associated with the closest meaning vectors is returned. This is like retrieving the books from the shelves based on their codes.

    participant User

    participant VS as Vector Store
    participant Embeddings
    participant Docs as Documents

    User->>QP: Asks "What are LLMs?"
    QP->>Embeddings: Converts question to vector
    QP->>VS: Searches for similar vectors
    VS->>Docs: Retrieves associated documents based on vectors
    Docs->>QP: Returns relevant documents
```

## Vector Store in Code (Simplified)

```python
# backend/retrieval.py (simplified)
from langchain_weaviate import WeaviateVectorStore

# ... other code ...

with retrieval.make_retriever(config) as retriever:
    docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)
    # docs now contains the relevant documents from the Vector Store
```

This code shows how we use a `retriever` (which uses a Vector Store like Weaviate) to get relevant documents based on a `query`.

## Looking Under the Hood: `get_relevant_documents`

When `get_relevant_documents` is called:

1. The `query` is converted into an embedding using an [Embeddings](04_embeddings_.md) model.
2. This embedding is used to search the Vector Store.
3. The Vector Store returns the most similar document embeddings and their associated documents.
4. These documents are returned by the `get_relevant_documents` function.

```python
# backend/retrieval.py (simplified)
from langchain_weaviate import WeaviateVectorStore

# ... other code to connect to Weaviate ...

store = WeaviateVectorStore(
    client=weaviate_client, # Connect to Weaviate
    index_name=WEAVIATE_DOCS_INDEX_NAME, # Name of the index/collection
    text_key="text", # Key for the text content
    embedding=embedding_model, # Embedding model to use
    attributes=["source", "title"], # Additional metadata
)
retriever = store.as_retriever(search_kwargs=search_kwargs)
docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)
```

This simplified code snippet shows how a `WeaviateVectorStore` is initialized and used to retrieve documents.  The `search_kwargs` can be used to fine-tune the search process.

## Conclusion

The Vector Store is essential for efficient retrieval of relevant information. By converting text into meaning vectors and storing them in a specialized database, we can quickly find the most relevant information for a given query.  Now that we understand the Vector Store, let's explore how text is converted into meaning vectors in the next chapter: [Embeddings](04_embeddings_.md).
