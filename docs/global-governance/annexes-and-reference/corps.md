# Integration of HMS-ACH with CORPS

This document outlines how the Health Management System – Aviation Crew Health (HMS-ACH) component integrates with the Command Operational Readiness and Planning System (CORPS). It covers:

1. Specific HMS-ACH capabilities aligned to CORPS mission needs  
2. Technical integration approach (APIs, data flows, authentication)  
3. Benefits and measurable improvements for CORPS stakeholders  
4. Implementation considerations in the CORPS environment  
5. Concrete use cases demonstrating end-to-end integration

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing CORPS Mission Needs

- **Real-Time Crew Health Monitoring**  
  • Continuous vital-sign telemetry (heart rate, oxygen saturation) via wearable sensors  
  • Automated health-status dashboards for flight surgeons and mission planners  

- **Predictive Readiness Analytics**  
  • Machine-learning models to forecast fatigue, stress, injury risk  
  • “Crew Readiness Score” metric feeds directly into crew-assignment algorithms  

- **Medical Event Alerting & Workflow**  
  • Tiered alert thresholds (e.g., elevated heart rate in high-G maneuvers)  
  • Automated creation of medical-support tickets and medevac requests  

- **Digital Health Records & Documentation**  
  • FHIR-compliant repository of crew medical histories, immunizations, waivers  
  • Rapid “fit-for-duty” clearance signature by flight surgeons  

- **Mobile & Edge-Enabled Access**  
  • Tablet and smartphone clients for forward-deployed medics  
  • Offline caching with secure sync once connected  

These capabilities directly support CORPS’s objective to optimize crew readiness, mission planning, and risk-informed decision-making.

## 2. Technical Integration

### 2.1 API & Data-Exchange Standards  
- **RESTful FHIR APIs**  
  • HMS-ACH exposes patient and observation resources (Patient, Observation, Condition).  
  • CORPS consumes via HTTPS endpoints, JSON payloads.  
- **HL7 v2.x Event Messaging**  
  • Real-time alerts (e.g., critical vital sign thresholds) published over an MQ or JMS bus.  
- **Webhooks / Event Subscriptions**  
  • CORPS subscribes to “CrewReadinessScoreUpdated” events for dynamic mission re-planning.

### 2.2 Data Flows  
1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - Wearables → HMS-ACH Edge Gateway → Secure Health Data Lake  
2. **Analytics & Scoring**  
   - Batch/stream processing produces readiness scores  
3. **Data Propagation**  
   - HMS-ACH API → CORPS mission-planning module  
   - CORPS GUI refreshes crew-assignment boards  
4. **Alerting**  
   - Critical events → HL7 feed → CORPS Incident Management → Pager/mobile push

### 2.3 Security & Authentication  
- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect** for API access tokens  
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** on all service-to-service calls  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  • Flight surgeon, medic, planner roles enforced in both CORPS and HMS-ACH  
- **FIPS-140-2 Encryption** at rest and in transit  
- **Audit Logging** for compliance with DoD IL6 (HIPAA) requirements

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Metric/Benefit                     | Baseline        | Post-Integration Target | Improvement (%) |
|------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Time to Crew-Ready Clearance       | 48 hrs          | ≤ 24 hrs                | 50%             |
| Mission Delay due to Medical Issues| 10 incidents/mo | ≤ 5 incidents/mo        | 50%             |
| Medevacs Initiated within SLA      | 80%             | ≥ 95%                   | +15 pp          |
| Planner Workload (manual updates)  | 5 hrs/day       | 2 hrs/day               | 60%             |
| Predictive Incident Accuracy       | N/A             | 85% target              | N/A             |

- **Faster Turnaround:** Automated health checks halve clearance time.  
- **Reduced Risk:** Early risk detection reduces in-flight medical events.  
- **Resource Optimization:** Dynamic re-roster reduces over- or under-staffing by 20%.  
- **Decision Support:** Planners gain real-time visibility, cutting manual updates.

## 4. Implementation Considerations for CORPS

- **Data Governance & Classification**  
  • Define data‐owner roles, retention policies for sensitive health records.  
  • Ensure COMSEC/INFOSEC alignment with CORPS high‐side enclaves.

- **Interoperability Testing**  
  • Execute FHIR conformance tests (profiling to DoD Implementation Guide).  
  • Validate HL7 event flows via integration lab before field deployment.

- **Change Management & Training**  
  • Train medical and planning personnel on new dashboards and workflows.  
  • Phased rollout: start with one squadron before enterprise-wide adoption.

- **Infrastructure & Scalability**  
  • Leverage CORPS container platform (Kubernetes) to host HMS-ACH microservices.  
  • Implement auto-scaling on peak mission periods.

- **Regulatory Compliance**  
  • Ensure HMS-ACH modules meet HIPAA, FDA Medical Device Directive (if applicable).  
  • Perform cybersecurity ATO within CORPS Authority to Operate process.

## 5. Use Cases

### 5.1 Dynamic Mission Planning  
1. CORPS mission-planner selects aircraft + crew for next sortie.  
2. HMS-ACH “Crew Readiness Score” API returns real-time health readiness.  
3. Planner swaps in a higher-scored crew member, optimizing mission success probability.

### 5.2 In-Flight Medical Alert & Response  
1. Wearable sensor triggers elevated G-force alert.  
2. HMS-ACH publishes an HL7 message into CORPS Incident Manager.  
3. Flight-surgeon on CORPS dashboard approves precautionary landing; support assets are auto-notified.

### 5.3 Predictive Crew Rotation  
1. Overnight batch analytics forecast high fatigue risk for Pilot A in 48 hrs.  
2. CORPS auto-schedules a rest period and reassigns Pilot B.  
3. Notification flows to crew, reducing last-minute re-deployments.

### 5.4 Forward Deployed Medic Support  
1. Forward medic’s tablet (HMS-ACH mobile app) syncs crew medical histories when connectivity permits.  
2. In case of injury, medevac request is created in CORPS with embedded patient vitals and location.  
3. CORPS allocates nearest medevac asset and tracks en route time.
