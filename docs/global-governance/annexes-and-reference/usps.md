# United States Postal Service (HMS-NFO Integration)

## Agency Overview

Leverages data analytics to improve mail delivery, optimize logistics, and enhance customer service nationwide.

**Core Function:** Universal physical communication infrastructure

## First Principles Analysis

The USPS exists to provide universal mail service connecting all American communities regardless of profitability. Its core function is maintaining a nationwide delivery network that enables communication and commerce across geographic and economic divides. The agency operates on the principle that postal service is a public good requiring uniform rates and service standards despite varying costs of delivery. Its structure as a self-funding entity with public service obligations creates inherent tensions, recognizing that effective universal service requires balancing commercial practices with the fundamental mission of binding the nation together through reliable, affordable mail delivery.

### Fundamental Principles

- Communication access is essential regardless of location or economic status
- Physical delivery network connects all communities to information and commerce
- Last-mile service to every address requires cross-subsidization model
- Communication networks serve both commercial and civic purposes

### Key Mechanisms

- Maintain nationwide network of post offices and delivery routes
- Process and deliver mail and packages to every address
- Operate self-funding service through postage and service fees
- Provide universal service regardless of geographic remoteness
