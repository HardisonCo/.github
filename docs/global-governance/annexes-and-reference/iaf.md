# Inter-American Foundation (HMS-NFO Integration)

## Agency Overview

Supports grassroots development projects in Latin America and the Caribbean, fostering citizen-led solutions to poverty.

**Core Function:** Decentralized development facilitation

## First Principles Analysis

The IAF exists to promote development through direct engagement with grassroots organizations rather than government-to-government assistance. Its core function is channeling resources to community-led initiatives that conventional development approaches might overlook. The agency operates on the principle that sustainable development emerges from local knowledge and participation, with projects designed and implemented by communities themselves. Its structure emphasizes flexibility and direct relationships with grantees, recognizing that effective grassroots development requires responsive funding mechanisms and context-specific approaches rather than standardized programs.

### Fundamental Principles

- Bottom-up development creates more sustainable outcomes than top-down programs
- Direct funding to local organizations bypasses bureaucratic inefficiencies
- Community-driven initiatives reflect authentic local priorities
- Small-scale grants can catalyze larger economic and social changes

### Key Mechanisms

- Fund community-designed and operated projects directly
- Provide technical training to enhance local capacity
- Create networks between grassroots organizations across regions
- Measure impact through community-defined success metrics
