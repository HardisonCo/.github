# Integration of HMS-ACH HMS with Employment

This document outlines how the HMS-ACH HMS component can integrate with an Employment system, detailing capabilities, technical integration, benefits, implementation considerations, and illustrative use cases.

## 1. Specific Capabilities Addressing Employment’s Mission

- **Role & Credential Management**  
  - Automated onboarding and offboarding of staff  
  - Real-time tracking of certifications, licenses, background checks  
- **Shift Scheduling & Allocation**  
  - AI-driven optimization of staffing levels vs. anticipated workload  
  - Self-service portal for employees to swap or bid on shifts  
- **Time & Attendance Capture**  
  - Biometric or badge‐based clock-in/clock-out integrated into timesheets  
  - Overtime alerts and exception reporting  
- **Payroll & Billing Reconciliation**  
  - Automatic consolidation of worked hours, pay rates, differential pay  
  - Export to accounting/payroll modules or external ERP  
- **Compliance & Reporting**  
  - Regulatory compliance dashboards (labor laws, safety training)  
  - Audit trails for all HR events

## 2. Technical Integration

### 2.1 APIs & Data Flows
- **RESTful Endpoints (JSON)**  
  - `/employees` (GET/POST/PUT) — sync master employee records  
  - `/shifts` (GET/POST) — push/pull scheduled assignments  
  - `/timecards` (POST) — transmit clock-in/out events  
  - `/credentials` (GET) — retrieve license/credential status
- **Streaming / Event Bus**  
  - Use of Kafka topics or AWS Kinesis for real-time attendance and alert events  
- **Batch Interfaces**  
  - SFTP pickup of nightly CSVs (fallback for legacy payroll systems)

### 2.2 Authentication & Security
- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect** for user-facing portals  
- **Mutual TLS** for server-to-server API calls  
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** with short-lived tokens for high-volume calls  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** enforced in both systems  
- **Data Encryption** at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+)

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

- **Operational Efficiency**  
  - 40% reduction in manual scheduling adjustments  
  - 25% faster onboarding via automated credential checks
- **Cost Control**  
  - 15% decrease in overtime spend through optimized staffing  
  - Elimination of duplicate data-entry errors saves ~200 labor hours/month
- **Compliance & Risk Mitigation**  
  - 100% real-time visibility into expiring licenses—zero compliance fines  
  - Immutable audit log reduces investigation time by 60%
- **Employee Engagement**  
  - 30% increase in shift‐swap requests handled via self-service  
  - Faster payroll processing leads to higher satisfaction scores

## 4. Implementation Considerations for Employment

- **Data Mapping & Governance**  
  - Align Employment’s data model (employee IDs, job codes) with HMS-ACH schema  
  - Define master data sources and reconciliation rules  
- **Security & Privacy**  
  - Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) for personal data  
  - Ensure adherence to GDPR/CCPA (where applicable)  
- **Infrastructure & Scalability**  
  - Containerize services (Docker/Kubernetes) for auto-scaling  
  - Load-test API endpoints for peak‐hour traffic
- **Organizational Change Management**  
  - Training for HR, payroll, and operations teams  
  - Phased rollout: pilot in one department → iterate → enterprise-wide  
- **Vendor & Third-Party Coordination**  
  - SLAs for uptime, support, and incident response  
  - Certification of mutual TLS certificates and key-rotation policies

## 5. Use Cases

### 5.1 Automated Shift Assignment  
1. Employment sends projected demand & staff availabilities via  `/shift-demand` API.  
2. HMS-ACH runs optimization, returns optimal roster.  
3. Employment pushes finalized roster into its LMS/payroll.

### 5.2 License Expiry Alert & Remediation  
1. HMS-ACH scans credential expiry dates daily.  
2. If a license is due to expire in <30 days, HMS-ACH emits an “expiry_alert” event.  
3. Employment’s HR portal receives event, notifies employee and auto-books recertification.

### 5.3 Biometric Time Capture → Payroll Sync  
1. Employee clocks in via kiosk; HMS-ACH records timecard event.  
2. Event is streamed in real time to Employment’s time & attendance module.  
3. At the end of the pay period, Employment aggregates approved timecards for payroll run.

### 5.4 Compliance Dashboard  
1. HMS-ACH exposes a `/compliance/status` endpoint with real-time metrics.  
2. Employment’s executive dashboard polls endpoint every hour.  
3. Managers view drill-down reports on training, hours worked, incident logs.

By leveraging HMS-ACH’s robust scheduling, credentialing, and API-driven architecture, the Employment system will achieve greater automation, improved compliance, and measurable cost savings—all while enhancing the employee experience.
