# HMS-ACH Integration with 

# Integration of the HMS-ACH Component into UNION

This document outlines how the HMS-ACH (Automated Clearing House) module can be integrated with UNION to streamline financial workflows, accelerate settlements, and improve end-to-end transparency across stakeholders.

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing UNION’s Mission

- **Real-Time Payment Orchestration**  
  • Instant credit/debit postings  
  • Support for ACH batches, same-day ACH, and cross-border rails  

- **Automated Reconciliation Engine**  
  • Matching of incoming/outgoing transactions to invoices, claims or contracts  
  • Exception-handling dashboard with configurable business rules  

- **Compliance & Reporting**  
  • Built-in support for NACHA, ISO 20022, SEPA, and PSD2 file formats  
  • Audit trails, timestamping, and CSR-grade encryption for regulatory submission  

- **Flexible Settlement Models**  
  • Net-settlement, gross-settlement, and escrow accounts  
  • Dynamic transfer scheduling and threshold-based release  

- **Analytics & Dashboarding**  
  • KPIs on processing times, error rates, cost per transaction  
  • Forecasting modules for cash-flow planning

## 2. Technical Integration

### 2.1 APIs & Interfaces
- **RESTful API Layer**  
  • Endpoints for transaction submission (`/v1/payments`), status checks (`/v1/payments/{id}`), reconciliation reports (`/v1/reconciliation`)  
  • JSON payloads with schema validation (OpenAPI/Swagger)  
- **Legacy/Batch Interfaces**  
  • SFTP-based ACH file uploads/downloads (NACHA flat-file format)  
  • Optional SOAP endpoints for legacy clients  

### 2.2 Data Flows
1. UNION submits a payment request or ACH batch via REST or SFTP.  
2. HMS-ACH validates and normalizes data against UNION’s master data tables.  
3. Cleared transactions are routed to the banking network or partner rails.  
4. Incoming settlement confirmations and returns are captured, matched, and pushed back to UNION via webhook or message queue.  

### 2.3 Authentication & Security
- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect** for user‐ and client‐level access tokens  
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** on all API endpoints for transport‐level security  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** mapped to UNION’s organizational roles  
- **Payload Encryption** (fields like account numbers, SSNs) using FIPS 140-2 certified libraries

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements for UNION Stakeholders

| Stakeholder          | Benefit                                    | Metric / KPI                              |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Finance & Treasury   | Faster settlement cycle                    | ↓ Settlement time from 48 hrs → < 2 hrs   |
| Operations           | Higher straight-through processing (STP)   | ↑ STP rate from 75% → 98%                 |
| Compliance & Audit   | Robust audit trails + regulatory reporting | ↓ Manual compliance hours by 60%          |
| Business Units       | Real-time visibility into cash flow        | Live dashboards; daily vs. monthly reports|
| IT & DevOps          | Simplified integration & maintenance       | ↓ Integration bugs by 40%; ↑ uptime to 99.9% |

## 4. Implementation Considerations Specific to UNION

- **On-Prem vs. Cloud Deployment**  
  • Assess data-residency requirements in target regions (EU, US, APAC)  
  • Leverage containerized microservices for scale; Kubernetes or managed PaaS  

- **Data Governance & Privacy**  
  • Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance for member/patient data  
  • Define data-retention policies aligned with banking regulations  

- **Change Management & Training**  
  • Phased rollout: Sandbox → Pilot (select business units) → Full-scale production  
  • User training on new dashboards, exception workflows, and SLA monitoring  

- **Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity**  
  • Multi-AZ or multi-region failover  
  • RTO < 1 hour, RPO < 15 minutes for critical payment flows  

- **SLAs & Support Model**  
  • 24×7 monitoring, Tier 1–3 support, runbooks for failover and incident response  
  • Quarterly reviews to tune reconciliation rules and performance thresholds

## 5. Use-Cases in Action

### Use-Case 1: Hospital Claim Disbursement  
1. UNION’s claims engine approves a reimbursement.  
2. HMS-ACH REST API receives the disbursement request.  
3. Funds are routed via same-day ACH; status updates posted back to UNION.  
4. Automatic reconciliation matches claim ID to payment; exceptions (if any) flagged in UNION’s dashboard.  

### Use-Case 2: Supplier Net-Settlement  
1. Monthly invoice data from 150 suppliers is exported as NACHA files to HMS-ACH via SFTP.  
2. HMS-ACH net-settles all payables, initiates a single bulk payment.  
3. Remittance advices and detailed supplier statements auto-uploaded into UNION’s ERP.  

### Use-Case 3: Cross-Border Tuition Fee Collection  
1. UNION collects tuition fees from international students in multiple currencies.  
2. HMS-ACH routes transactions through foreign-exchange rails, handles FX conversion.  
3. Real-time FX rates and fee breakdowns flow back into UNION’s finance module for ledger posting.

By embedding HMS-ACH into the UNION ecosystem, the organization gains a robust, standards-compliant clearing engine, slash payment cycle times, and improve transparency and control across all financial flows.
