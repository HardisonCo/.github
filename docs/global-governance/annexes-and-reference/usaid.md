# U.S. Agency for International Development (HMS-NFO Integration)

## Agency Overview

Drives global development efforts, using analytics to target humanitarian aid, economic growth, and democracy initiatives.

**Core Function:** International development coordination

## First Principles Analysis

USAID exists to advance U.S. foreign policy objectives through development assistance that improves lives in recipient countries. Its fundamental purpose is promoting economic growth, democratic governance, and human welfare as complements to traditional diplomacy and defense. The agency operates on the principle that sustainable development requires building local capacity rather than creating dependency. Its programming spans humanitarian response, economic development, health, education, and governance, recognizing that effective development assistance requires both addressing immediate needs and building systems that can function independently over time.

- Technical assistance builds capacity for self-sufficiency

### Key Mechanisms

- Provide grants and contracts for development projects worldwide
