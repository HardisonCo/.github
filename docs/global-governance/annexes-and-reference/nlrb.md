# National Labor Relations Board (HMS-NFO Integration)

## Agency Overview

Protects employees' rights, investigates unfair labor practices, and oversees union elections.

**Core Function:** Labor organization process management

## First Principles Analysis

The NLRB exists to facilitate orderly resolution of labor-management disputes through defined processes rather than economic warfare. Its fundamental purpose is enforcing employees' rights to organize and bargain collectively while protecting employers from unfair labor practices. The agency operates on the principle that industrial peace requires both clear rules and neutral mechanisms to enforce those rules. Its structure separates investigative and prosecutorial functions from adjudicative ones, recognizing that effective labor relations regulation requires both vigorous enforcement of rights and impartial resolution of disputes.

### Fundamental Principles

- Power imbalances between employers and individual workers create need for collective representation
- Orderly process for determining representation prevents industrial conflict
- Labor-management negotiation requires formal structure and enforcement
- Employment relationships involve competing interests requiring mediation

### Key Mechanisms

- Conduct and certify representation elections
- Investigate and remedy unfair labor practices
- Enforce collective bargaining obligations
- Interpret labor law through case adjudication
