# Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (HMS-NFO Integration)

## Agency Overview

Insures bank deposits, supervises financial institutions, and safeguards stability in the U.S. banking system.

**Core Function:** Banking system confidence maintenance

## First Principles Analysis

The FDIC exists to prevent bank runs by removing the incentive for depositors to withdraw funds during periods of uncertainty. Its fundamental purpose is maintaining confidence in the banking system through explicit guarantees that protect ordinary savers. The agency operates on the principle that financial stability requires both preventative supervision and resolution mechanisms when institutions fail. Its structure integrates insurance with regulatory oversight, recognizing that protecting the insurance fund requires ongoing assessment of bank safety and soundness to minimize the likelihood of having to make depositors whole.

### Fundamental Principles

- Fractional reserve banking creates inherent liquidity vulnerabilities
- Bank runs are contagious and self-reinforcing without intervention
- Public confidence is essential for banking system functionality
- Bank failures create systemic risks beyond individual institutions

### Key Mechanisms

- Guarantee deposits up to specific limits to prevent panicked withdrawals
- Conduct regular examinations to identify institutional risks early
- Resolve failing institutions with minimal market disruption
- Manage receivership process to protect insured depositors
