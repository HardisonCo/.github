## 2. Technical Integration Approach

### 2.1 APIs & Data Flows  
- **RESTful API Endpoints**  
  • Patient/Case Retrieval: GET /hms-ach/review/cases  
  • Submit Review Findings: POST /hms-ach/review/{caseId}/findings  
  • Fetch Analytics Data: GET /hms-ach/analytics/review?startDate=…&endDate=…  
- **Event-Driven Interfaces**  
  • Webhooks for real-time case updates (e.g., status change, new attachment)  
  • Message queue (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ) for high-volume audit logs  
- **Data Formats**  
  • JSON payloads with FHIR R4 extensions for clinical data  
  • CSV/JSON export for bulk reporting  

### 2.2 Authentication & Authorization  
- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect**  
  • REVIEW obtains access tokens from HMS-ACH authorization server  
  • Fine-grained scopes (e.g., `cases.read`, `findings.write`, `reports.read`)  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  • HMS-ACH enforces REVIEW user roles (Reviewer, Supervisor, Auditor)  
  • REVIEW’s SSO can provision roles via SCIM into HMS-ACH  

### 2.3 Data Synchronization & Security  
- **Bi-Directional Sync**  
  • Scheduled nightly full sync of master patient/index data  
  • Real-time delta sync for case updates via webhooks  
- **Encryption & Compliance**  
  • TLS 1.2+ for in-transit data  
  • AES-256 encryption at rest in HMS-ACH databases  
  • Quarterly penetration testing and vulnerability scans

## 4. Implementation Considerations for REVIEW

- **Data Governance**  
  • Establish a joint data dictionary to align HMS-ACH fields with REVIEW terminologies  
  • Define ownership and stewardship for shared data elements  
- **Change Management**  
  • Phased rollout: pilot with one department before enterprise-wide deployment  
  • Training curriculum for reviewers, supervisors, and auditors  
- **Customization & Configuration**  
  • Tailor HMS-ACH forms to REVIEW’s unique review categories and checklists  
  • Configure SLA and escalation rules according to REVIEW’s service-level policies  
- **Infrastructure & Hosting**  
  • Leverage REVIEW’s cloud environment (AWS/Azure/GCP) or HMS-ACH-managed SaaS  
  • Ensure network peering or secure VPN for private data exchange  
- **Testing & Validation**  
  • Unit and integration tests for each API endpoint  
  • End-to-end user acceptance testing (UAT) with representative review cases  
- **Regulatory Compliance**  
  • Joint review of HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA)  
  • Data residency controls if REVIEW operates in restricted jurisdictions

## 5. Use Cases

### 5.1 Real-Time Case Assignment & Review  
1. REVIEW’s triage engine POSTs a new review case to HMS-ACH.  
2. HMS-ACH assigns to the next available reviewer and fires a webhook back to REVIEW.  
3. REVIEW’s dashboard highlights the new assignment; reviewer clicks “Open in HMS-ACH.”  
4. Reviewer completes structured findings; HMS-ACH returns a summary payload to REVIEW for archival.

### 5.2 Automated Compliance Check & Escalation  
1. Upon submission of findings, HMS-ACH runs policy rules (e.g., missing signatures, out-of-range values).  
2. If a violation is detected, HMS-ACH flags the case with severity and notifies REVIEW’s escalation queue via API.  
3. REVIEW’s escalations UI surfaces the case for immediate supervisor action.  

### 5.3 Analytics-Driven Performance Management  
1. REVIEW requests weekly performance report from HMS-ACH via `GET /analytics/review`.  
2. HMS-ACH returns JSON with reviewer throughput, average time/case, and error rates.  
3. REVIEW ingests the data into its BI tool to create executive dashboards and trend analyses.  

### 5.4 Audit Discovery & Evidence Gathering  
1. During an external audit, REVIEW’s auditor issues a request for all actions on Case #12345.  
2. REVIEW calls `GET /hms-ach/review/12345/audit-log` and retrieves an ordered list of user actions.  
3. JSON log is rendered in REVIEW’s compliance portal, and PDF export is provided to the auditor.
