# HMS-ACH Integration with 

# Integration of HMS-ACH with the (&) Platform

This document outlines how the HMS-ACH (Automated Claims Handling) component of our Hospital Management System (HMS) can be integrated into the (&) platform, delivering streamlined billing, faster reimbursements, and improved stakeholder outcomes.

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing (&)’s Mission Needs

- **Automated Claim Generation**  
  • Transforms encounter and discharge data into HIPAA-compliant X12 837 claims  
  • Applies payer-specific business rules (coding edits, bundling, authorization checks)

- **Real-Time Eligibility & Benefits Verification**  
  • Queries insurers via EDI 270/271 or FHIR InsurancePlan endpoints  
  • Prevents ineligible or out-of-network charges at the point of care

- **Rule-Based Adjudication & Validation**  
  • Applies configurable rule sets to catch errors (missing modifiers, duplication)  
  • Reduces claim denials by up to 30% through front-end validation

- **Remittance & ERA Processing**  
  • Ingests Electronic Remittance Advice (X12 835, FHIR ExplanationOfBenefit)  
  • Automatically posts payments, adjustments, and denials back into HMS ledgers

- **Dashboards & Analytics**  
  • Monitors denial rates, days in A/R, cash-posting velocity  
  • Generates KPI reports for revenue cycle improvement

## 2. Technical Integration Architecture

### A. Data Flows

1. **Encounter → Claim**  
   - HMS core posts finalized encounter data to HMS-ACH via internal message queue (e.g., Kafka/RabbitMQ).  
   - HMS-ACH transforms and pushes claim payloads to (&) via REST/EDI gateway.

2. **Real-Time Eligibility**  
   - At registration or pre-authorization, (&) issues a synchronous HTTPS call to HMS-ACH’s eligibility API.  
   - HMS-ACH returns coverage details in JSON or FHIR format.

3. **Remittance Receipt & Posting**  
   - (&) forwards EDI 835/JSON ERA to HMS-ACH’s inbound SFTP or API endpoint.  
   - HMS-ACH parses, applies to open claims, and notifies HMS core for patient billing updates.

### B. APIs & Protocols

- **RESTful APIs** (JSON/FHIR)  
  • /api/v1/claims (POST)  
  • /api/v1/eligibility (GET)  
  • /api/v1/remittance (POST)

- **EDI Support**  
  • X12 270/271 (eligibility)  
  • X12 837 (claims)  
  • X12 835 (remittance)

- **Secure File Transfer**  
  • SFTP with PGP encryption for batch EDI files

### C. Authentication & Security

- **OAuth 2.0 / JWT** for REST APIs  
- **Mutual TLS** for inter-service communication  
- **API Keys** scoped to specific operations (read vs. write)  
- **HIPAA-compliant** logging, audit trails, and data encryption at rest/in transit

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Benefit                           | KPI / Metric                        | Expected Improvement       |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Denial Rate Reduction             | % of claims denied                  | From 12% → 7% (‐5 pts)     |
| Days in Accounts Receivable (A/R) | Average days to paid claim          | From 45 days → 28 days     |
| Staff Productivity                | Claims processed per FTE / month    | +40%                       |
| Cash-Posting Velocity             | Time from remittance to ledger post | From 3 days → 1 day        |
| Patient Satisfaction              | Billing-related complaints          | ‐30%                       |

- **Faster Revenue Cycle**  
  – Accelerated claim submission and remittance posting  
- **Reduced Manual Work**  
  – Automated validation and posting frees finance staff for exceptions  
- **Actionable Insights**  
  – Real-time dashboards guide process improvements and denial appeals

## 4. Implementation Considerations for (&)

- **Data Governance & Compliance**  
  • Align on HIPAA Business Associate Agreements (BAA)  
  • Validate Data Use & Retention policies

- **Mapping & Transformation**  
  • Develop a canonical data model between HMS-ACH and (&)  
  • Handle payer-specific code sets and updates

- **Change Management**  
  • Joint training for billing, IT, and revenue-cycle teams  
  • Roll-out in phased pilots (by department or payor type)

- **High Availability & Scaling**  
  • Deploy HMS-ACH in a containerized cluster (Kubernetes) with auto-scaling  
  • Ensure SLAs for API response times (<200 ms)

- **Monitoring & Support**  
  • Centralized logging (ELK/Prometheus) for early error detection  
  • 24×7 support agreement between HMS and (&)

## 5. Integration Use Cases

### Use Case A: Outpatient Claim Submission
1. Patient registers for imaging study in (&).  
2. (&) invokes HMS-ACH eligibility API → confirms coverage.  
3. After service, HMS core publishes encounter to HMS-ACH.  
4. HMS-ACH applies rules, generates X12 837 → transmits to (&) clearinghouse.  
5. (&) returns 999 Functional Acknowledgement → HMS-ACH logs success.

### Use Case B: Real-Time Denial Prevention
1. During pre-certification, (&) calls the HMS-ACH rule-engine API with proposed CPT/ICD codes.  
2. HMS-ACH flags potential bundling conflict → returns error message.  
3. Clinician adjusts ordering codes to comply, preventing future denials.

### Use Case C: Automatic Remittance Posting
1. (&) receives EDI 835 from insurer at midnight.  
2. SFTP-drop triggers HMS-ACH ingestion job.  
3. Payments and adjustments auto-post to HMS billing ledger.  
4. HMS core updates patient account balances; finance team notified of exceptions.
