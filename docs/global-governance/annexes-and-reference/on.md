# HMS-ACH Integration with 

# Integration of HMS-ACH with ON

This document outlines how the HMS-ACH (Health Management System – Automated Clinical Hub) component can integrate with and benefit ON’s mission. It covers capabilities, technical architecture, stakeholder benefits, ON-specific considerations, and illustrative use cases.

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing ON’s Mission  
HMS-ACH offers modular, scalable health-IT functionality that aligns to ON’s objectives of secure, real-time patient data management, analytics, and compliance.

- **Real-Time Clinical Data Aggregation**  
  • Consolidates vitals, labs, imaging, and EHR events via standard connectors  
  • Delivers streamed updates to care teams and dashboards  
- **Advanced Analytics & Alerting**  
  • Rules-based engine for anomaly detection (e.g. sepsis alerts)  
  • Predictive models for resource utilization and patient risk scoring  
- **Unified Patient Record**  
  • Master Patient Index (MPI) for de-duplication and record linking  
  • Longitudinal view across multiple care sites  
- **Standards-Based Interoperability**  
  • HL7v2/HL7 FHIR interfaces, DICOM, and CDA support  
  • Terminology services (SNOMED CT, LOINC)  
- **Security & Compliance**  
  • Role-based access control, audit trails, encryption at rest/in transit  
  • GDPR, HIPAA, and ON data-sovereignty compliance modules

## 2. Technical Integration Architecture  
Integration leverages a service-oriented approach, minimizing disruption to ON’s existing systems.

### 2.1 APIs & Data Flows  
- **Inbound Feeds**  
  • EHR ➔ HMS-ACH via HL7v2 or FHIR Subscriptions  
  • Medical devices ➔ MQTT or Webhook streams  
- **Outbound Services**  
  • FHIR RESTful APIs for querying patient records, observations, care plans  
  • Event notifications (Kafka or Webhooks) to ON’s downstream systems  
- **Batch & Bulk Operations**  
  • Bulk FHIR Data Import/Export for historical migrations  
  • Scheduled ETL jobs to ON’s Data Warehouse  

### 2.2 Authentication & Authorization  
- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect** for user and service clients  
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** for machine-to-machine trust  
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)** with scope claims enforcing least-privilege  
- **LDAP / SAML2** integration for ON’s enterprise identity provider  

### 2.3 Data Mapping & Transformation  
- Canonical data model in HMS-ACH, with XSLT or MapForce transformations  
- Terminology normalization using FHIR ConceptMap resources  
- Message validation and enrichment via an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements for Stakeholders  

| Stakeholder       | Benefit                                 | Measure                   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Clinicians        | Faster access to complete patient data | – 50% reduction in lookup time<br>– 25% fewer charting errors |
| Care Coordinators | Automated alerts for care gaps         | – 40% increase in preventive interventions |
| IT Operations     | Simplified maintenance & monitoring    | – 30% decrease in support tickets<br>– 99.9% uptime |
| Executives        | Data-driven decision support           | – Dashboards updated in real time<br>– 15% cost avoidance in adverse events |

## 4. ON-Specific Implementation Considerations  

1. **Legacy System Coexistence**  
   - Assess EHR versions, custom interfaces  
   - Use interface adapters to avoid “rip & replace”  
2. **Data Residency & Privacy**  
   - Deploy HMS-ACH in ON-approved cloud enclaves or on-prem clusters  
   - Ensure encryption keys controlled by ON’s security team  
3. **Change Management & Training**  
   - Phased rollout: Pilot in one department, then scale  
   - Role-based training modules: clinician, lab, admin  
4. **Governance & Compliance**  
   - Joint ON/HMS-ACH governance board for release prioritization  
   - Quarterly security assessments and penetration tests  
5. **Performance & Scalability**  
   - Autoscaling microservices behind Kubernetes  
   - Performance benchmarks: <200 ms API latency, 10,000 events/sec

## 5. Use Cases in Action  

### 5.1 Emergency Department Triage  
- **Flow:** Patient arrives → vital signs auto-streamed → HMS-ACH risk engine triggers high-risk alert → ED nurse receives push notification → orders expedited  
- **Outcome:** 30% faster triage decision, reduced adverse events  

### 5.2 Chronic Care Management  
- **Flow:** Remote glucose monitor ➔ HMS-ACH FHIR ingestion ➔ trend analysis flags out-of-range values ➔ care coordinator schedules telehealth visit  
- **Outcome:** 20% drop in hospital readmissions  

### 5.3 Cross-Facility Transfer  
- **Flow:** Patient transfer from Clinic A to Hospital B → MPI match in HMS-ACH merges records → Hospital B clinicians access full history instantly  
- **Outcome:** Zero duplicate charts, improved continuity of care  

### 5.4 Executive Dashboard & Reporting  
- **Flow:** Aggregated data wired into ON’s BI platform via FHIR Bulk Data → real-time KPI dashboards (bed occupancy, ALOS, compliance rates)  
- **Outcome:** Data-driven resource allocation, 10% better throughput

By integrating HMS-ACH with ON’s ecosystem, ON will achieve seamless interoperability, bolster clinical decision support, secure patient data, and realize measurable improvements across its mission areas.
