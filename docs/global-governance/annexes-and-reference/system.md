# HMS-ACH Integration with 

# Integration of HMS-ACH with (SYSTEM)

This document outlines how the HMS-ACH (Health Management System – Adaptive Care Hub) component can integrate with and enhance the capabilities of the (SYSTEM). We cover (1) HMS-ACH capabilities that meet mission needs, (2) technical integration approach, (3) stakeholder benefits and metrics, (4) implementation considerations, and (5) illustrative use cases.

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing (SYSTEM) Mission Needs

- **Unified Patient Record**  
  – Consolidates admissions, encounters, vitals, lab results, imaging, and medication data  
  – Ensures a single source of truth across deployed units and rear-area hospitals  
- **Real-Time Monitoring & Alerts**  
  – Event-driven alerts for abnormal vitals, trauma triage, or readiness flags  
  – Dashboard views for casualty flow and bed utilization  
- **Telemedicine & Remote Consultation**  
  – Secure video-chat, image sharing, and consult routing  
  – On-demand specialist liaison (e.g., combat surgeon, psychiatrist)  
- **Supply Chain & Logistics Interface**  
  – Tracks medical supplies and pharmaceuticals down to unit level  
  – Automated reordering with configurable thresholds  
- **Analytics & Reporting**  
  – Pre-built reports for casualty statistics, resource consumption, and medical readiness  
  – Export to common formats (PDF/CSV) or downstream analytics engines

## 2. Technical Integration Approach

### 2.1 APIs & Data Flows
- **RESTful FHIR API**  
  • Expose HMS-ACH patient, encounter, and medication resources via HL7 FHIR R4  
  • CRUD endpoints: `/Patient`, `/Encounter`, `/Observation`, `/MedicationRequest`  
- **Event Bus / Messaging**  
  • JMS or AMQP broker for near-real-time alerts (e.g., new admission, triage code red)  
  • Topics: `HMS.ACH.Encounter.Created`, `HMS.ACH.Observation.Alert`  
- **Batch Data Exchange**  
  • SFTP or HTTPS file drops of consolidated CSV/JSON nightly for archival or analytics  

### 2.2 Authentication & Authorization
- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect**  
  • HMS-ACH issues JWTs after validating (SYSTEM) credentials via Identity Provider (IdP)  
  • Scope-based access tokens (e.g., `read:Encounter`, `write:MedicationRequest`)  
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)**  
  • Enforce certificate-based authentication on all API endpoints for high-assurance data transfer  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  • Map (SYSTEM) roles (e.g., medic, commander, logistics-officer) to HMS-ACH roles/PDAs

## 3. Stakeholder Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Stakeholder     | Benefit                                    | Metric / KPI                                 |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Clinicians      | Faster patient data retrieval              | ↓ Time-to-chart (target: 60 sec → 15 sec)     |
| Commanders      | Real-time operational health picture       | ↑ Situational awareness (dashboard uptime 99.9%) |
| Logistics       | Automated resupply, reduced stockouts      | ↓ Stockout incidents (target: –75%/month)     |
| IT Operations   | Modern API-driven architecture             | ↓ Custom integrations (target: 3→1)           |
| Data Analysts   | Rich, standardized datasets for reporting  | ↑ Report generation speed (target: –50%)      |

## 4. Implementation Considerations

1. **Infrastructure & Deployment**  
   - Containerize HMS-ACH (Docker/Kubernetes) to match (SYSTEM) cluster topology  
   - Hybrid cloud/on-prem topology for forward-deployed clinics  
2. **Data Mapping & Migration**  
   - Map existing (SYSTEM) data fields to FHIR resources  
   - Execute ETL jobs during low-traffic windows with data validation rules  
3. **Security & Compliance**  
   - Ensure IL-5 data handling standards (or equivalent classification)  
   - Perform penetration testing and continuous monitoring (SIEM integration)  
4. **Performance & Scalability**  
   - Load-test APIs at peak casualty rates (e.g., 500+ admissions/hr)  
   - Configure auto-scaling policies on event-bus brokers  
5. **Change Management & Training**  
   - Develop e-learning modules for medics on HMS-ACH workflows  
   - Schedule joint drills to validate end-to-end data flow  
6. **Support & SLAs**  
   - 24×7 helpdesk with tied response times (P1 < 1 hr)  
   - Regular software patching aligned with (SYSTEM) maintenance windows

## 5. Use Cases

### 5.1 Real-Time Patient Tracking in Theater  
1. Combat medic logs a new casualty via (SYSTEM) mobile app.  
2. HMS-ACH receives a FHIR `POST /Encounter` event.  
3. Encounter details appear instantly on the theater casualty dashboard.  
4. Automated alert (JMS topic) routes case to nearest surgical team.

### 5.2 Telemedicine Consultation  
1. Forward clinic triggers an e-consult request for complex trauma.  
2. HMS-ACH schedules a secure video link and shares attached imaging via REST API.  
3. Specialist annotates images; recommendations returned as `Observation` resources.

### 5.3 Automated Medical Supply Replenishment  
1. Field unit’s stock levels fall below threshold in HMS-ACH inventory module.  
2. Event bus publishes `Inventory.LowThreshold` message.  
3. (SYSTEM) Logistics Engine auto-issues a resupply order; tracks fulfillment.

### 5.4 Operational Reporting for Command Decisions  
1. Nightly batch extracts all encounters, outcomes, and resource usage.  
2. (SYSTEM) Data Warehouse ingests CSV/JSON drop from HMS-ACH.  
3. Command staff reviews interactive dashboards (casualty trends, bed capacity).

By leveraging HMS-ACH’s unified clinical data model, real-time event framework, and secure API-centric architecture, (SYSTEM) will significantly enhance medical situational awareness, streamline clinical workflows, and improve logistics efficiency across the enterprise.
