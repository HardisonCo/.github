# HMS-ACH Integration with 

# Integration of HMS-ACH with the EDUCATION Mission

This document outlines how the HMS-ACH (Health Management System – Access & Credentials Hub) component can be integrated into an Education-focused environment to meet mission needs, technical requirements, stakeholder benefits, and real-world use cases.

---

## 1. Capability Alignment with EDUCATION Mission Needs

HMS-ACH provides a suite of identity, access, and credentialing services that map directly to the needs of an Education organization, such as a medical school, training academy, or continuing-education department:

- **Centralized Identity & Profile Management**  
  – Single source of truth for students, faculty, clinical instructors, and administrative staff  
  – Syncs user attributes (role, department, certifications) across all downstream systems

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  – Dynamic role assignment (e.g., “Third-Year Medical Student,” “Lab Instructor”)  
  – Fine-grained permissions for sensitive data (e.g., grading records, patient de-identified cases)

- **Automated Credentialing & Certification Tracking**  
  – Onboarding workflows for new learners/instructors  
  – Renewal reminders for mandatory certifications (e.g., HIPAA, infection control)

- **Audit & Compliance Reporting**  
  – Traceable audit logs of who accessed what and when  
  – Pre-built reports to demonstrate compliance with FERPA, HIPAA, and accreditation bodies

- **Self-Service Portal**  
  – User-friendly dashboard for updating profiles, requesting role changes, and downloading training transcripts

## 2. Technical Integration Overview

### 2.1 API Interfaces & Data Flows
- **RESTful API Endpoints**  
  – `POST /users` – Create or update user records  
  – `GET /users/{id}/roles` – Retrieve role assignments  
  – `POST /credentials/renew` – Trigger certification renewal workflows

- **FHIR-based Data Exchange** (optional)  
  – Leverage HL7 FHIR resources (Practitioner, PractitionerRole) to integrate with clinical and simulation platforms  
  – Support for SMART on FHIR for secure data access in research and training apps

- **Event-Driven Messaging**  
  – Publish/subscribe via Kafka or RabbitMQ  
  – User-onboarded → “education.user.created” → triggers LMS account creation

### 2.2 Authentication & Authorization
- **OAuth2 / OpenID Connect**  
  – Single-sign-on (SSO) for LMS (Canvas, Blackboard), simulation software, and mobile apps  
- **SAML 2.0**  
  – Federation with university’s central identity provider (IdP)  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
  – Enforced for privileged roles (e.g., system administrators, faculty)

### 2.3 Data Synchronization
1. **Initial Provisioning**  
   – Sync existing student/faculty roster via CSV or a secure SFTP feed  
2. **Ongoing Updates**  
   – Webhooks notify HMS-ACH of roster changes; automatic reconciliation  
3. **De-provisioning**  
   – Graduations or separation events → auto-revoke system access

## 3. Expected Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Stakeholder        | Benefit                                    | Metric / Improvement                              |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Students           | Faster access to course materials & labs    | Onboarding time ↓ 80%                              |
| Faculty            | Easier management of class rosters & labs   | Administrative overhead ↓ 50%                      |
| IT / Admin         | Reduced help-desk tickets                   | Access–related tickets ↓ 60%                       |
| Compliance Officers| Instant visibility into training status     | Audit prep time ↓ 75%                              |
| Finance / Budget   | Optimized license usage                     | Unused seat licensing costs ↓ 40%                  |

## 4. Implementation Considerations for EDUCATION

- **Regulatory Compliance**  
  – FERPA for student records; HIPAA for clinical rotations  
  – Data encryption at rest and in transit (TLS 1.2+)

- **Stakeholder Change Management**  
  – Role-based training for faculty and staff  
  – Phased rollout: pilot department → all-campus deployment

- **Integration with Existing Systems**  
  – LMS (Canvas, Blackboard), Student Information System (SIS), e-portfolio tools  
  – Single sign-on configuration with institutional IdP (Shibboleth, ADFS)

- **Scalability & High Availability**  
  – Support peak loads (e.g., semester start)  
  – Geo-redundant deployment for multi-campus institutions

- **Data Governance**  
  – Data retention policies (transcript storage, audit logs)  
  – Periodic access reviews and recertification campaigns

## 5. Sample Use Cases

### 5.1 New Student Onboarding
1. Registrar uploads new cohort roster to SIS.  
2. SIS triggers “new.student” webhook to HMS-ACH.  
3. HMS-ACH provisions accounts in LMS, simulation lab portal, and library systems.  
4. Student receives welcome email with SSO link and initial training checklist.

### 5.2 Mandatory Clinical Training Roll-out
1. Curriculum Office marks a new `InfectionControl2024` credential in HMS-ACH.  
2. All incoming clinical students are automatically enrolled.  
3. HMS-ACH tracks completion dates and sends renewal reminders 30 days prior to expiration.  
4. Compliance dashboard flags late completions for program directors.

### 5.3 Faculty Role Change
1. Instructor completes administrative request for “Course Director” role.  
2. HMS-ACH workflow routes approval to Department Chair.  
3. Upon approval, new permissions in gradebook, course scheduling, and lab reservation systems are granted instantly.

# Conclusion

By integrating HMS-ACH into the EDUCATION mission space, institutions gain a centralized, auditable, and automated approach to identity, access, and credential management. This not only streamlines day-to-day operations but also drives measurable improvements in onboarding speed, compliance posture, and overall user satisfaction.
