# Integration of HMS-ACH with the ADVISORY System

This document outlines how the HMS-ACH (Health Management System – Advanced Care Hub) component can integrate with and enhance the ADVISORY platform. It covers:  
1. Key HMS-ACH capabilities aligned to ADVISORY’s mission  
2. Technical integration approach  
3. Stakeholder benefits and metrics  
4. Implementation considerations  
5. Example use cases

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing ADVISORY’s Mission

| HMS-ACH Capability        | Mission Alignment for ADVISORY                      |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Real-time Vital Monitoring**   | Enables proactive risk assessment and timely alerts   |
| **Medication Management & Reconciliation** | Ensures accurate medication advisories, reducing errors |
| **Automated Clinical Alerts**   | Drives immediate clinician and patient notifications |
| **Secure Messaging & Tele-care**| Facilitates direct patient–provider communication   |
| **Care Plan Tracking & Scheduling** | Coordinates follow-ups, referrals and appointment reminders |

- By integrating these capabilities, ADVISORY can shift from reactive advice to truly proactive, personalized care recommendations.

## 2. Technical Integration

### 2.1 APIs & Data Models  
- **RESTful FHIR-compliant APIs**  
  - Patient, Practitioner, Encounter, MedicationRequest, Observation resources  
- **Event-Driven Webhooks**  
  - Subscriptions to HMS-ACH alert channels (e.g., “high-risk vital”, “med non-adherence”)  
- **Batch Data Exchanges**  
  - Bulk export/import of care plans, visit summaries via secure SFTP or HL7 v2 bundles  

### 2.2 Data Flows  
1. **Initial Sync:**  
   - ADVISORY calls `GET /Patient` and `GET /CarePlan` on HMS-ACH  
2. **Ongoing Updates:**  
   - HMS-ACH publishes webhook events (e.g., new Observation → POST /advisory/events)  
3. **User Actions:**  
   - ADVISORY issues `POST /MedicationRequest` to update med orders in HMS-ACH  
4. **Reporting:**  
   - Nightly ETL jobs push usage and outcome metrics back into ADVISORY’s analytics warehouse  

### 2.3 Authentication & Security  
- **OAuth 2.0 (Client Credentials Grant)** for server-to-server API calls  
- **OpenID Connect** for user-facing sessions  
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** on all production endpoints  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** ensures least-privilege

## 3. Stakeholder Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Stakeholder        | Benefit                                                 | Metric                                         |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Care Managers      | Unified dashboard of high-risk patients                 | ↓ 30% time to identify at-risk individuals     |
| Physicians         | Automated med reconciliation reduces charting burden    | ↓ 40% medication error rate                    |
| Nurses             | Instant clinical alerts guide timely interventions      | ↓ 25% response time to critical alerts         |
| Patients           | Proactive reminders and tele-visits improve engagement  | ↑ 20% appointment adherence                    |
| Administrators     | Data-driven view of outcomes for quality reporting      | ↑ 15% compliance with quality metrics (e.g., HEDIS) |

## 4. Implementation Considerations for ADVISORY

- **Data Mapping & Normalization**  
  - Align code sets (SNOMED, LOINC, RxNorm) between systems  
- **Compliance & Privacy**  
  - Ensure HIPAA- and GDPR-compliant data handling  
- **Scalability & Performance**  
  - Leverage horizontal scaling for event processing during peak hours  
- **User Training & Change Management**  
  - Role-based training modules for clinicians, care coordinators, IT staff  
- **Governance & Support**  
  - Define an escalation matrix for integration incidents  
  - Schedule quarterly architecture reviews

## 5. Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Early Deterioration Warning  
1. HMS-ACH Records a Sudden Rise in Patient’s Heart Rate  
2. Sends “High-Risk Observation” Webhook to ADVISORY  
3. ADVISORY Triggers Clinician Alert & Suggests Tele-Triage  
4. Nurse conducts a tele-visit, adjusts care plan  

_Outcome: Reduces unplanned ER visits by catching issues at home._

---

### Use Case 2: Medication Non-Adherence Outreach  
1. HMS-ACH flags missed doses via Smart‐pillbox integration  
2. ADVISORY composes automated reminder SMS or call  
3. If no response, escalates to care manager with contextual notes  

_Outcome: Improves adherence rates; lowers hospital readmissions._

---

### Use Case 3: Post-Discharge Care Coordination  
1. HMS-ACH loads new discharge summary as a CarePlan  
2. ADVISORY schedules follow-up telehealth visit, sends reminders  
3. System tracks vital sign submissions pre-visit; alerts if out of range  

_Outcome: Enhances transitional care, meets 30-day readmission reduction targets._

---

### Use Case 4: Chronic Disease Management Campaign  
1. Bulk export of diabetes patient cohort from HMS-ACH  
2. ADVISORY runs analytics, identifies patients needing A1c tests  
3. Sends personalized outreach, schedules lab appointments  

_Outcome: Boosts screening compliance; improves population health scores._
