# National Science Foundation (HMS-NFO Integration)

## Agency Overview

Accelerates research breakthroughs and fosters innovation across scientific disciplines.

**Core Function:** Fundamental research investment coordination

## First Principles Analysis

The NSF exists to advance fundamental scientific knowledge without immediate application requirements. Its core function is funding research that might not attract private investment despite its potential for transformative impact. The agency operates on the principle that scientific progress requires both support for established fields and willingness to explore high-risk, high-reward questions. Its peer review system balances scientific merit with broader impacts, recognizing that effective science funding requires both technical assessment by domain experts and consideration of how research contributes to national priorities beyond the specific scientific questions addressed.

### Fundamental Principles

- Basic scientific research creates foundation for future applications and innovations
- Market incentives underfund basic research due to uncertain commercialization timelines
- Scientific progress requires peer-reviewed merit-based funding allocation
- Cross-disciplinary coordination maximizes research efficiency

### Key Mechanisms

- Fund investigator-initiated research proposals through competitive review
- Support research infrastructure and facilities for broad scientific use
- Develop STEM education and workforce capacity
- Facilitate research partnerships across institutions and sectors

## HMS-NFO Integration

The HMS-NFO system provides specialized data and analytics services tailored to National Science Foundation's mission. The following components are particularly relevant:

- **Internet Data Collection System**: Gathers trade and economic data from public sources
- **Data Access API**: Provides standardized access to HMS-NFO data
