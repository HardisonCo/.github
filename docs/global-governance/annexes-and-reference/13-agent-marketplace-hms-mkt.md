# Chapter 13: Agent Marketplace (HMS-MKT)

*(Follow-up to [Model Context Protocol (HMS-MCP)](12_model_context_protocol__hms_mcp__.md))*

## 1. Why Do We Need an ‚ÄúApp Store for AI Agents‚Äù?

Imagine **Tina**, a zoning clerk at the **Bureau of Reclamation** in a small Western county.

1. A citizen submits plans for a solar farm.  
2. Tina must calculate permit fees, check for protected historic sites, and verify veteran-owned business discounts.  
3. Her 4-person IT team has **no time or budget** to build three separate AI tools.

Tina opens the **Agent Marketplace (HMS-MKT)**, searches *‚ÄúSolar Farm Permit‚Äù*, clicks **Install**, and‚Äîwithin minutes‚Äîthree pre-vetted agents appear in her dashboard:

```
‚úî Permit Fee Calculator        ¬∑ $0.01 / run
‚úî Historic Site Predictor       ¬∑ $0.005 / run
‚úî Veterans Benefit Optimizer    ¬∑ free (VA grant)
```

No procurement marathon, no custom coding.  
**HMS-MKT** puts niche expertise at every agency‚Äôs fingertips‚Äîexactly like an app store, but for **policy-aware, MCP-secured AI agents**.

## 2. Key Concepts (Plain English)

| Concept               | Friendly Meaning                                                   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Listing               | The ‚Äúapp-store page‚Äù for one agent (description, price, docs).     |
| Sandbox               | A safe playground that lets you test the agent with fake data.     |
| Rating                | 1‚Äì5 ‚≠ê from other agencies (‚ÄúWorks great for building permits!‚Äù).   |
| License               | Usage contract (free, pay-per-use, annual flat fee).               |
| Install Token         | Signed proof that your agency may run the agent in production.     |
| Billing Meter         | Counter that records each agent invocation for later invoicing.    |

Keep these six words in mind; the rest of MKT is just plumbing that glues them together.

## 3. Two-Minute Tour ‚Äì Browsing, Testing, Installing

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Tina
    participant MKT as HMS-MKT
    participant SBX as Sandbox Runner
    participant AGT as HMS-AGT
    Tina->>MKT: Search "solar"
    MKT-->>Tina: List 3 agents
    Tina->>SBX: Try "Historic Site Predictor"
    SBX-->>Tina: Result (no sites within 2 km)
    Tina->>MKT: Click Install
    MKT->>AGT: Register agent + install token
    AGT-->>Tina: Agent live in dashboard
```

Tina never touches YAML, Docker, or billing invoices‚Äîthe Marketplace handles it all.

## 4. Hands-On: Installing an Agent in < 20 Lines

### 4.1 Browse & Install (CLI)

```bash
# 1) Find an agent
hms-mkt search "permit fee"

# 2) Install it for your agency (auto-checks budget & license)
hms-mkt install permit-fee-calculator@2.3.1
```

CLI output:

```
‚úÖ Installed permit-fee-calculator@2.3.1
   Install-Token: MKT-7fd2‚Ä¶d8
   Sandbox URL : https://sandbox.hms.gov/run/7fd2‚Ä¶d8
```

### 4.2 Call the Agent From Your Code

```javascript
import { callAgent } from 'hms-agt-sdk'

const fee = await callAgent({
  name: 'permit-fee-calculator',
  version: '2.3.1',
  input: { projectSize: 2.5, zone: 'RURAL' }   // MW & zoning class
})
console.log(`üí∞ Permit fee = $${fee.total}`)
```

Explanation  
1. `callAgent` looks in HMS-AGT‚Äôs registry.  
2. The **Install Token** proves you‚Äôre licensed.  
3. Billing Meter adds $0.01 to the monthly invoice.

---

## 5. What Happens Behind the Curtain?

### 5.1 Step-by-Step

1. **Install**  
   * HMS-MKT verifies license & budget ‚Üí issues **Install Token** (JWT).  
   * Registers the agent‚Äôs Docker image in your cluster.

2. **Execution**  
   * Your service calls HMS-AGT with the token.  
   * MCP envelope (from Chapter 12) is attached automatically.  
   * Agent runs in a **Sandbox Pod** with CPU/RAM limits.

3. **Billing & Rating**  
   * Billing Meter logs the call (`agent-id`, `cost`, `timestamp`).  
   * Tina can leave a ‚≠ê rating that helps others pick quality agents.

### 5.2 Micro-Service Map

```
hms-mkt/
 ‚îú‚îÄ api/           REST routes (search, install, rate)
 ‚îú‚îÄ catalog/       JSON files for every listing
 ‚îú‚îÄ sandbox/       spins up temp pods for tests
 ‚îú‚îÄ billing/       counts usage
 ‚îî‚îÄ ratings/       1‚Äì5 star DB table
```

## 6. Internal Code Nuggets (All ‚â§ 20 Lines)

### 6.1 Listing Format (`catalog/permit-fee-calculator.json`)

```json
{
  "name": "permit-fee-calculator",
  "version": "2.3.1",
  "price": 0.01,
  "schema": {
    "input":  { "projectSize": "number", "zone": "string" },
    "output": { "total": "number" }
  },
  "sandboxCmd": ["node", "run.js"]
}
```

### 6.2 Install Route (`api/install.js`)

```javascript
router.post('/install/:name', async (req,res)=>{
  const { name } = req.params
  const listing = catalog.get(name)
  checkBudget(req.user.agency, listing.price)
  const token = makeInstallToken(req.user.agency, listing)
  await agt.register(listing, token)       // talks to HMS-AGT
  res.json({ ok:true, token })
})
```

*Checks budget ‚Üí creates token ‚Üí tells AGT to pull the image ‚Üí returns JSON.*

### 6.3 Billing Meter (`billing/hook.js`)

```python
def on_agent_called(agent_id, cost, agency):
    db.insert('billing', {
      'agent':agent_id, 'cost':cost,
      'agency':agency, 'ts':now()})
```

One hook; every call is billable or free (cost = 0).

## 7. Adding **Your** Agent to the Marketplace

1. **Scaffold**

```bash
npx hms-mkt new-agent solar-profit-estimator
cd solar-profit-estimator
```

2. **Implement** `main.py` (‚â§ 20 lines):

```python
def run(projectSize, zone):
    base = 500
    multiplier = 200 if zone=="URBAN" else 100
    return { "total": base + projectSize*multiplier }
```

3. **Describe & Publish**

```bash
hms-mkt publish --price 0.005 --tag "solar,finance"
```

CI checks:
* passes unit tests  
* no PHI or PII leak (static scan)  
* schema valid  

Once approved, your agent appears in the catalog for every agency.

---

## 8. Safety Rails & Governance

* **Sandbox** = read-only file-system + outbound-only network.  
* **MCP Enforcement** = agents see only the scopes in the caller‚Äôs envelope.  
* **Human-in-the-Loop** (next chapter) can force manual approval for high-risk agents.  
* **Open Ratings** = one-star bombs ignored; only verified installs count.  
* **Auto-Patch** = critical CVEs trigger automatic image rebuilds and notifications.

## 9. Beginner FAQ

**Q: Do I pay upfront?**  
No. Monthly invoice combines all pay-per-use totals; free agents cost $0.

**Q: Can I run an agent on-prem?**  
Yes‚ÄîMarketplace pushes images to your private registry; nothing leaves your firewall.

**Q: What if an update breaks my workflow?**  
You pin a version (`permit-fee-calculator@2.3.1`). Upgrades are manual unless you enable ‚Äúauto-minor.‚Äù

**Q: How large can an agent image be?**  
Max 1 GB. Bigger images are rejected to keep cold-start times low.
