# Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (HMS-NFO Integration)

## Agency Overview

Adjudicates disputes arising from OSHA enforcement, promoting safer workplaces nationwide.

**Core Function:** Workplace safety enforcement adjudication

## First Principles Analysis

The OSHRC exists to provide independent adjudication of workplace safety and health disputes. Its core function is ensuring fair and consistent application of occupational safety laws through impartial resolution of contested enforcement actions. The agency operates on the principle that administrative justice requires separation between enforcement and adjudication functions. Its structure emphasizes independence from OSHA, recognizing that effective safety regulation requires both vigorous enforcement by the regulatory agency and fair processes for employers to contest citations, with decisions based on factual evidence and legal interpretation rather than enforcement targets.

### Fundamental Principles

- Safety standards enforcement requires balanced application across diverse workplaces
- Independent review prevents regulatory overreach while ensuring appropriate protections
- Due process rights apply to regulatory enforcement actions
- Specialized knowledge required to evaluate technical workplace hazards

### Key Mechanisms

- Adjudicate disputes between employers and safety enforcement agency
- Interpret workplace safety regulations through case decisions
- Balance worker protection with practical implementation concerns
- Create precedent for consistent standard application
