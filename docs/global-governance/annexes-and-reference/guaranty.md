# Integration of HMS-ACH into GUARANTY’s Hospital Management Ecosystem

This document analyzes how the HMS-ACH module of the Hospital Management System (HMS) can be integrated with and add value to GUARANTY’s mission. Sections cover core capabilities, technical integration, stakeholder benefits, implementation nuances, and illustrative use cases.

## 2. Technical Integration Architecture

### 2.1 Data Flows
1. **Admission → Eligibility Check**  
   GUARANTY’s Admission module calls HMS-ACH’s Eligibility API to verify guarantor coverage and coverage limits in real-time.  
2. **Charge Capture → Claim Generation**  
   On charge finalization in the HMS Billing engine, a webhook pushes a JSON/Payload to the HMS-ACH Claim Service.  
3. **Claim Submission & Status**  
   HMS-ACH transforms the payload into EDI or FHIR and transmits to external payers or GUARANTY’s clearinghouse. A scheduled poller retrieves acknowledgments (EDI 999/277CA) and status updates (EDI 277/835).  
4. **Remittance Posting → A/R Reconciliation**  
   Remittance files are ingested via SFTP or API, parsed, and matched to open claims; discrepancies get flagged in the HMS-ACH dashboard.  

### 2.2 APIs & Protocols
- **RESTful JSON APIs:**  
  • POST /eligibility-check  
  • POST /claims  
  • GET /claims/{claimId}/status  
  • POST /remittance  
- **HL7/FHIR Interfaces:**  
  • FHIR ChargeItem, CoverageEligibilityRequest/Response, Claim, ClaimResponse  
- **EDI Transports:**  
  • AS2 (X12), SFTP (flat files), HTTPS with MIME encapsulation  

### 2.3 Security & Authentication
- **OAuth2 + JWT tokens** for application-to-application calls  
- **Mutual TLS** for external payer connections (AS2)  
- **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)** within the HMS portal  
- **Data encryption at rest** (AES-256) & **in transit** (TLS 1.2+)

## 4. Implementation Considerations Specific to GUARANTY

- **Data Governance & Privacy**  
  • Ensure HMS-ACH data schemas align with GUARANTY’s data classification policies  
  • Conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment and update Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)  
- **Mapping GUARANTY Product Lines**  
  • Configure billing rules and cost-share logic for GUARANTY’s unique coverage tiers  
  • Extend custom fields in the guarantor entity for contractual nuances  
- **Change Management & Training**  
  • Role-based training sessions for billing, clinical, and IT staff  
  • Sandbox environment reflecting GUARANTY’s live data for UAT  
- **Cutover Strategy**  
  • Phased rollout by department (e.g., admit/discharge first, then claims)  
  • Parallel processing & reconciliation for a 2-week stabilization window  
- **Ongoing Support Model**  
  • 24×7 support SLAs with tiered escalation (L1: HMS-ACH helpdesk, L2: integration team)  
  • Quarterly review of KPIs & change requests

## 5. Illustrative Use Cases

### Use Case A: Real-Time Eligibility at Check-In
1. Front-desk enters patient/guarantor demographics  
2. HMS invokes `POST /eligibility-check` → HMS-ACH verifies coverage & benefit balance  
3. Eligibility response populates pre-registration form (co-pay & deductible due)  
4. Patient signs acknowledgment; system auto-creates payment plan if needed  

### Use Case B: Automated Claim Scrubbing & Submission
1. Charge posting completes in HMS Billing  
2. HMS-ACH claim-scrubber applies payer rules and highlights missing data  
3. Clean claims auto-transmit via AS2; exceptions routed to billing staff’s queue  
4. 999/277CA response reconciled → Claims with errors are auto-routed for correction  

### Use Case C: Instant Denial Alert & Appeal Workflow
1. Payer returns an EDI 835 with a denial code  
2. HMS-ACH flags the claim, notifies the revenue cycle manager via email/SMS  
3. Manager opens the appeal template in HMS-ACH, populates missing info, and submits to payer  
4. Dashboard tracks appeal status; escalates if no response in X days  

### Use Case D: End-of-Month A/R Reconciliation
1. HMS-ACH aggregates all remittance postings and open claims  
2. System runs automated reconciliation, highlighting unmatched items  
3. Finance team reviews exceptions in a consolidated report  
4. Reconciled figures sync to GUARANTY’s ERP/General Ledger via API
