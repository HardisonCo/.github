# HMS-ACH Integration with 

# Integration of HMS-ACH with the HOUSING System

This document analyzes how the **HMS-ACH** component—an Automated Clearing House (ACH) payment and reconciliation module within the Hospital Management System (HMS) family—can integrate with and benefit the HOUSING mission.

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing HOUSING Mission Needs

- **Automated Rent & Fee Collections**  
  • Schedule and process recurring tenant rent payments via ACH debit  
  • Handle one-time charges (late fees, service fees) with minimal manual intervention  

- **Secure Tenant Disbursements**  
  • Direct deposit security deposit refunds or utility rebates to tenant bank accounts  
  • Multi-party payments (e.g., owner distributions, vendor payouts for maintenance)  

- **Real-Time Payment Status & Recon**  
  • Immediate status updates (Settled, Returned, Pending) through NACHA standard codes  
  • Automated posting to general ledger and tenant billing ledgers  

- **Compliance & Audit Trail**  
  • NACHA-compliant templates, encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+), at-rest data tokenization  
  • Comprehensive logging for audit, dispute resolution, and exception handling  

- **Reporting & Analytics**  
  • Dashboards for day-end payment totals, exception rates, return reasons  
  • Customizable reports for quarterly budgeting, cash-flow forecasting, and KPI tracking

## 2. Technical Integration Architecture

### 2.1 APIs and Data Flows
- **RESTful API Endpoints**  
  • `/ach/transactions` (POST) – Initiate payment batches  
  • `/ach/status/{batchId}` (GET) – Retrieve batch/transaction status  
  • `/ach/reconcile` (PUT) – Send daily settlement file for reconciliation  
- **Payload Formats**  
  • JSON body for transaction details (tenant ID, bank routing, amount, effective date)  
  • CSV/ NACHA-formatted files for batch uploads via SFTP as fallback  

### 2.2 Authentication & Security
- **OAuth 2.0 / JWT**  
  • Token issuance per client (HOUSING) with role‐based scopes: `ach:read`, `ach:write`, `ach:recon`  
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)**  
  • Ensures both HOUSING and HMS-ACH endpoints verify each other’s certificates  
- **Encryption**  
  • AES-256 at rest; TLS v1.2+ in transport  
  • PII fields (account numbers) tokenized in the database  

### 2.3 Error & Exception Handling
- **Webhooks & Callbacks**  
  • Asynchronous notifications for rejected or returned transactions  
- **Retry Logic**  
  • Configurable back-off for transient network issues  
- **Dashboard Alerts**  
  • Email/SMS alerts when return rates exceed thresholds

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Benefit                        | Metric / KPI                    | Baseline | Target Improvement |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------|--------------------|
| Reduced Payment Processing Costs | Cost per transaction          | \$1.25    | \$0.35 (72% ↓)     |
| Faster Time to Funds          | Average days from initiation to settlement | 3 days    | 1 day (66% ↓)      |
| Lower Error & Return Rates    | Return rate                     | 2.5%     | <1% (60% ↓)        |
| Improved Tenant Satisfaction  | NPS or survey score             | 65        | 80 (+23%)          |
| Staff Efficiency              | FTE hours/month on reconciliations | 120 hrs   | 40 hrs (67% ↓)     |

- **Financial Transparency**  
  • Real-time dashboards give HOUSING financial officers immediate view on cash flow  
- **Tenant Engagement**  
  • Automated reminders and self-service portals reduce late payments and inquiries

## 4. Implementation Considerations for HOUSING

- **Data Mapping & Cleanup**  
  • Standardize tenant banking data (routing/account formats) pre-migration  
- **Regulatory Compliance**  
  • Adhere to state housing finance regulations, Fair Housing Act (FHA) privacy rules  
- **Change Management**  
  • User training for finance staff and tenant portal support  
  • Phased rollout: pilot with 2–3 properties before enterprise-wide deployment  
- **System Dependencies**  
  • Integration with existing Housing Management Information System (HMIS) or ERP  
  • Database connectivity (SQL Server / Oracle) for posting ACH entries  
- **Disaster Recovery & SLA**  
  • 99.9% uptime SLA, RPO/RTO aligned with HOUSING’s continuity plan

## 5. Use Cases

### 5.1 Monthly Rent Collection
1. HOUSING schedules a monthly ACH debit batch via  
   `POST /ach/transactions`  
2. HMS-ACH validates accounts, enforces daily volume limits  
3. Status updates pushed back via webhook; successfully settled items automatically posted to tenant ledger  
4. Finance team views reconciled totals in the HMS-ACH dashboard  

### 5.2 Security Deposit Refund
1. Upon lease termination, HOUSING triggers `POST /ach/transactions` with refund details  
2. ACH batch clears next business day; any return (e.g., closed account) triggers a webhook to initiate alternative payment  
3. Automated audit entry created in HOUSING’s ERP  

### 5.3 Vendor Payment for Maintenance
1. Maintenance vendor invoices are approved in HOUSING’s ERP  
2. ERP calls `POST /ach/transactions` (credit to vendor bank)  
3. HMS-ACH performs positive pay check, issues payment, and logs full audit trail  

### 5.4 Exception & Return Management
1. Returned transactions push a callback to `/ach/status/{batchId}` with return reason codes  
2. HOUSING staff use HMS-ACH exception dashboard to correct data or rerun payments  
3. KPI reports automatically adjust for exception resolution time

By leveraging the **HMS-ACH** component, the HOUSING organization can streamline financial operations, reduce manual workload, strengthen compliance, and deliver better experiences for tenants and stakeholders alike.
