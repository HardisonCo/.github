# Chapter 6: Agent Orchestration Engine (HMS-ACT)

## 1. Why Do We Need HMS-ACT?

Picture a blizzard about to hit Washington, D.C.  
Within minutes the city must:

1. Draft an **‚ÄúEmergency Snow-Removal Plan.‚Äù** (done by the AI policy agent)  
2. Check the plan for **budget & union-rule compliance.** (done by the legal agent)  
3. **Dispatch plow crews** and notify residents. (done by several backend services)  
4. **Log every step** for a post-event audit.  

Without orchestration, each agent or service would shout orders at the same time‚Äîplows might leave before funding is cleared or the plan approved.

**HMS-ACT is the conductor.**  
It receives a *score* (an ordered list of tasks) and waves the baton so every agent plays in rhythm:

```
[ DraftPlan ] ‚Üí [ LegalCheck ] ‚Üí [ HumanApproval ] ‚Üí [ DispatchCrews ] ‚Üí [ NotifyCitizens ]
```

No task starts until the previous one finishes (or fails), and every outcome is written to the audit log.

## 2. Key Concepts in Plain English

| Term                | Analogy (Orchestra)                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Orchestration Plan  | The musical score‚Äîordered list of steps.            |
| Task                | One measure in the score (e.g., ‚Äúrun legal check‚Äù). |
| Agent / Service     | A musician who knows one instrument.                |
| Runner              | The metronome‚Äîexecutes tasks in sequence.           |
| Execution Log       | The recording‚Äîtimestamped history of the concert.   |

## 3. 3-Minute Hands-On Tour

We will orchestrate three toy steps:

1. `draft_policy` ‚Äì pretend AI writes the snow plan.  
2. `legal_check` ‚Äì second agent rubber-stamps it.  
3. `dispatch` ‚Äì backend service ‚Äúsends‚Äù the plows.

### 3.1 Submit a Plan to HMS-ACT (curl or fetch)

```bash
# submit_plan.sh  (‚â§10 lines)
curl -X POST https://api.hms/act/plans -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '
{
  "title": "Snow Removal Blizzard 2025",
  "steps": [
    { "task": "draft_policy", "agent": "agx" },
    { "task": "legal_check",  "agent": "esq" },
    { "task": "dispatch",     "service": "svc.snow" }
  ]
}'
```

Expected JSON reply (abridged):

```json
{ "planId": "PLAN-123", "status": "PENDING" }
```

### 3.2 Poll Status

```bash
curl https://api.hms/act/plans/PLAN-123/status
# ‚Üí {"currentStep": "legal_check", "overall": "IN_PROGRESS"}
```

When finished:

```bash
# ‚Üí {"overall": "COMPLETED", "log": [ ... ] }
```

**What just happened?**  
You gave ACT a simple list of steps. It is now:

1. Telling **HMS-AGX** to draft.  
2. Waiting for **HMS-ESQ** to say ‚ÄúLegal ‚úÖ.‚Äù  
3. Calling the **Snow Dispatch Service** in [HMS-SVC](05_backend_service_layer___apis__hms_svc__.md).  
4. Writing every result to the log.

## 4. What Happens Behind the Curtain?

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant ACT  as HMS-ACT
    participant AGX  as Draft Agent
    participant ESQ  as Legal Agent
    participant SVC  as Snow Service
    ACT->>AGX: Run draft_policy
    AGX-->>ACT: ‚úÖ draft complete
    ACT->>ESQ: Run legal_check
    ESQ-->>ACT: ‚úÖ legal OK
    ACT->>SVC: POST /dispatch
    SVC-->>ACT: üöö crews rolling
    ACT-->>Caller: Plan COMPLETED
```

In plain English:

1. **ACT** reads step 1, calls AGX.  
2. Waits until AGX returns success.  
3. Proceeds to legal check, waits again.  
4. Finally hits the dispatch endpoint.  
5. Marks the whole plan *COMPLETED* (or *FAILED* if any step errors).

## 5. Inside the Engine (Tiny Code Peek)

### 5.1 Runner Loop (Node.js, 18 lines)

```js
// services/hms-act/runner.js
async function runPlan(plan) {
  for (const step of plan.steps) {
    log(plan.id, step.task, 'START');
    try {
      if (step.agent) await callAgent(step.agent, step.task, plan);
      if (step.service) await callService(step.service, step.task, plan);
      log(plan.id, step.task, 'SUCCESS');
    } catch (err) {
      log(plan.id, step.task, 'FAIL', err.message);
      await markPlan(plan.id, 'FAILED');
      return;
    }
  }
  await markPlan(plan.id, 'COMPLETED');
}
module.exports = runPlan;
```

Explanation:

‚Ä¢ Iterates through `steps` one-by-one.  
‚Ä¢ Uses helper `callAgent` or `callService` depending on who should act.  
‚Ä¢ On error, stops the loop and labels the plan **FAILED**.  
‚Ä¢ Each stage logs to the Execution Log stored in [Central Data Repository (HMS-DTA)](07_central_data_repository__hms_dta__.md).

### 5.2 callAgent Helper (Python-style pseudocode, 10 lines)

```python
def call_agent(name, task, plan):
    url = f"https://api.hms/{name}/{task}"
    r   = httpx.post(url, json={"planId": plan["id"]})
    r.raise_for_status()          # throws if 4xx / 5xx
```

One simple HTTP call hides the complexity of each specialist agent.

### 5.3 Log Storage Schema (SQL, 6 lines)

```sql
CREATE TABLE act_logs (
  id        SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  plan_id   TEXT,
  step      TEXT,
  status    TEXT,     -- START / SUCCESS / FAIL
  ts        TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
  message   TEXT
);
```

Every row is a breadcrumb for auditors.

## 6. How HMS-ACT Connects to Other Layers

| Layer | Interaction |
|-------|-------------|
| [HMS-AGX](02_ai_representative_agent__hms_agx__.md) | Receives **task commands** like `draft_policy`. |
| [HMS-ESQ](08_legal___compliance_module__hms_esq__.md) | Performs legal checks as a task. |
| [HMS-SVC](05_backend_service_layer___apis__hms_svc__.md) | Executes concrete services (`/dispatch`, `/bill`). |
| [HMS-GOV](01_governance_layer___admin_portal__hms_gov__.md) | Shows plan status & lets admins cancel or retry. |
| [HITL](03_human_in_the_loop__hitl__oversight_.md) | Can inject a **HumanApproval** task before execution. |

## 7. Frequently Asked Questions

**‚ÄúCan tasks run in parallel?‚Äù**  
Yes. Add `"parallel": true` to a step group. The runner spawns them concurrently and waits for all to finish before moving on.

**‚ÄúWhat if a step needs manual retry?‚Äù**  
HMS-GOV exposes a **Retry** button that reinvokes `runPlan` starting at the failed step.

**‚ÄúIs sequencing fixed?‚Äù**  
A plan is just JSON. You can dynamically build it (e.g., AGX adds extra legal checks for international treaties).

## 8. What You Learned

‚Ä¢ HMS-ACT is the **conductor** ensuring agents and services perform in the right order.  
‚Ä¢ You submitted a 3-step emergency snow plan and watched ACT drive it to completion.  
‚Ä¢ Under the hood, a tiny runner loop, simple HTTP calls, and an execution log do the magic.  

Ready to see **where** all those logs and plans live?
