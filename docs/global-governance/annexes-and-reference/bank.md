# HMS-ACH Integration with 

# Integration of HMS-ACH into BANK’s Payment Infrastructure

This document outlines how the HMS-ACH subsystem can be integrated into BANK’s existing environment to support its mission of secure, compliant, and high-throughput Automated Clearing House (ACH) services.  

---

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Mapped to BANK’s Mission Needs

1. **High-Volume Batch Processing**  
   - Support for NACHA-compliant batch file creation and ingestion (Standard Entry Class codes: PPD, CCD, WEB, TEL, etc.)  
   - Scheduled “lights-out” processing windows for same-day and next-day ACH  

2. **Real-Time Monitoring & Alerting**  
   - Dashboard tracking of file statuses, settlement times, exception queues  
   - Configurable alerts (e.g., late files, rejects, returns) via email/SMS/operational console  

3. **Built-In Returns & Corrections**  
   - Automated parsing of ACH return codes (R-codes) and subsequent re-origination or notifications  
   - Support for prenotification (prenotes) and change-of-ownership workflows  

4. **Compliance & Audit Trail**  
   - Enforced NACHA rules engine (cut-off times, duplicate checks, length/format validations)  
   - Immutable audit logging of all submits, edits, approvals, and acknowledgements  

5. **Security & Fraud Prevention**  
   - Integration with positive pay templates and exception scoring (velocity checks, blacklists)  
   - End-to-end encryption (file at rest/in transit), role-based access control  

6. **Reporting & Reconciliation**  
   - Out-of-the-box reports: Day-End Balancing, Return Rate Trends, Originator Activity  
   - API-driven query set for custom dashboards and BI tools

## 2. Technical Integration Architecture

### 2.1 Data Flows

1. **Inbound Payment Instructions**  
   - Core Banking System → HMS-ACH API / SFTP drop-zone  
   - Format: JSON (via REST) or NACHA plaintext files  

2. **Processing & Enrichment**  
   - HMS-ACH validates against NACHA rules  
   - Data enrichment (e.g., add trace numbers, ACH network flags)  

3. **Outbound File Submission**  
   - HMS-ACH → Federal Reserve / ACH Operator  
   - Transport: SFTP with PGP encryption or secure MQ  

4. **Returns & Notifications**  
   - ACH Operator → HMS-ACH (via SFTP or Webhook)  
   - HMS-ACH updates status and pushes callbacks to Core Banking  

### 2.2 APIs & Protocols

- **RESTful Endpoints**  
  • POST /ach/batches → submit new payment batch  
  • GET /ach/batches/{id}/status → retrieve current state  
  • GET /ach/returns?date=… → list today’s return items  

- **File-Based Interfaces**  
  • SFTP inbound/outbound directories  
  • NACHA-format flat files with strict record-length checks  

- **Messaging / MQ**  
  • JMS or IBM MQ channels for low-latency file notifications  

### 2.3 Authentication & Security

- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect** for REST APIs  
- **Mutual TLS** certificates on SFTP and MQ channels  
- **LDAP/Active Directory** integration for RBAC  
- **AES-256** encryption for at-rest data; **TLS 1.2+** in transit

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Stakeholder           | Current Pain Point                       | HMS-ACH Improvement                 | KPI / Metric                         |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Operations            | Manual file checks, high exception load  | Automated rule-based clearing       | +75% reduction in manual exceptions  |
| Treasury/Risk         | Lack of real-time visibility             | Live dashboards & alerts            | 100% of late-file events detected    |
| Compliance            | Difficulty enforcing NACHA changes       | Embedded NACHA rules engine         | 0 audit findings on ACH compliance   |
| IT                    | Fragile home-grown scripts               | Turnkey APIs & connectors           | 50% fewer support tickets            |
| End Customers         | Delayed crediting/debiting               | Support for same-day ACH            | 99.9% on-time settlement rate        |

## 4. Implementation Considerations for BANK

1. **Infrastructure & Deployment**  
   - On-prem vs. Cloud (support for Docker/Kubernetes)  
   - High-availability clustering (active-active across data centers)  

2. **Data Mapping & Transformation**  
   - Align CUSTOMER and ACCOUNT schemas between Core Banking and HMS-ACH  
   - Develop transformation scripts or XSLT for custom fields  

3. **Regulatory Compliance**  
   - Ensure SAS-70/SSAE-18 controls if hosted  
   - Regular NACHA rule updates and patch processes  

4. **Security Review**  
   - Penetration testing of REST endpoints and SFTP  
   - Review of encryption key management and audit logs  

5. **Change Management & Training**  
   - Business-user workshops for new dashboards/alerts  
   - Run parallel pilot batches for a 2-week validation window  

6. **Cutover Strategy**  
   - Phase 1: Inbound batch submission only (no returns)  
   - Phase 2: Full two-way processing  
   - Phase 3: Move to same-day ACH and advanced fraud modules

## 5. Sample Use Cases

### 5.1 Corporate Payroll File Submission
- **Actor**: Corporate Client via Online Portal  
- **Flow**:  
  1. Client uploads payroll NACHA file to BANK’s portal.  
  2. BANK posts file to HMS-ACH `/ach/batches` API.  
  3. HMS-ACH validates and schedules for same-day.  
  4. Operations team monitors “Green” status on dashboard.  
  5. Funds settle at 5 PM; HMS-ACH sends callback to Core Banking to credit accounts.

### 5.2 NSF Return & Re-origination
- **Actor**: BANK’s Returns Desk  
- **Flow**:  
  1. HMS-ACH receives NSF return file from ACH Operator.  
  2. System flags the originator and posts an exception ticket.  
  3. Returns Desk reviews in UI, clicks “Re-originate.”  
  4. HMS-ACH auto-generates a new batch with correct payment date.  
  5. Re-origination status tracked via `/ach/returns/{id}` API.

### 5.3 Fraud Monitoring & Alerts
- **Actor**: Fraud Team  
- **Flow**:  
  1. Real-time ACH traffic flow into HMS-ACH; velocity rules detect multiple high-value debits.  
  2. System triggers alert to Fraud Slack channel and email.  
  3. Analyst reviews in the “Exceptions” screen, blocks suspicious originator.  
  4. Block decision logged in audit trail; nightly report auto-generated.

By leveraging HMS-ACH, BANK will achieve a robust, fully automated, and compliant ACH service line—delivering faster settlement, fewer exceptions, clearer audit trails, and a significantly reduced operational overhead.
