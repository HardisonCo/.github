# Office of Government Ethics (HMS-NFO Integration)

## Agency Overview

Promotes ethical standards across the executive branch, using advanced tools to track disclosures and prevent conflicts of interest.

**Core Function:** Public service integrity framework maintenance

## First Principles Analysis

The OGE exists to prevent conflicts of interest that would undermine public confidence in government impartiality. Its fundamental purpose is establishing standards and systems that promote ethical decision-making and minimize opportunities for personal gain from public service. The agency operates on the principle that ethical governance requires both clear rules and practical systems for financial disclosure and recusal. Its functions span policy development, training, and oversight of agency ethics programs, recognizing that effective ethics management requires both government-wide standards and agency-specific implementation suited to particular conflict risks.

### Fundamental Principles

- Democratic governance requires public trust in impartial decision-making
- Financial conflicts create incentives that compromise objective judgment
- Public officials should serve public rather than personal interests
- Preventative standards more effective than after-the-fact enforcement

### Key Mechanisms

- Establish financial disclosure requirements for officials
- Create standards for recusal from matters affecting personal interests
- Issue guidance on navigating potential conflicts
- Train ethics officials throughout government
