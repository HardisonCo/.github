# Enhancing Agency Use Cases with Real-World Issues

This document describes the Agency Issue Enhancement System for improving HMS agency documentation with real-world context.

## Overview

The Agency Issue Enhancement System is a powerful feature that enhances agency use cases with real-world issues identified through web search and analysis. This system:

- Searches the web for actual problems faced by government agencies
- Structures these issues into coherent problem statements
- Enhances existing use cases with real-world context
- Integrates the enhanced content into the agency documentation

## Key Components

### 1. Agency Issue Finder (`agency_issue_finder.py`)

This component searches the web for real-world issues related to government agencies and structures the findings into coherent problem statements. It can generate comprehensive documentation showing how HMS components can solve these problems.

### 2. Use Case Enhancement (`enhance_agency_use_cases_with_issues.py`)

This component takes existing agency use cases and enhances them with real-world issues identified by the Agency Issue Finder. It preserves the structure and flow of the original use cases while adding relevant real-world context.

### 3. Documentation Integration (`integrate_enhanced_use_cases.py`)

This component integrates enhanced use cases into the existing agency documentation structure. It adds a "Real-World Issues and Solutions" section to the use case documentation and creates links to the full enhanced use cases.

### 4. Batch Processing (`scripts/batch_integrate_enhanced_use_cases.sh`)

This script orchestrates the entire enhancement and integration process for multiple agencies in batch mode. It can process all predefined agencies or individual agencies as specified.

## Usage

### As Part of the HMS Documentation Pipeline

```bash
# Run just the enhancement and integration step
python3 run_hms_doc_pipeline.py enhance_integrate

# Run the complete pipeline including enhancement
python3 run_hms_doc_pipeline.py all
```

### Standalone Processing

```bash
# Process all predefined agencies
./scripts/batch_integrate_enhanced_use_cases.sh --all

# Process a specific agency
./scripts/batch_integrate_enhanced_use_cases.sh --agency ED "Department of Education" "distance learning challenges" education
```

### Advanced Usage

For more control, you can run the individual components directly:

```bash
# Enhance a use case
python3 enhance_agency_use_cases_with_issues.py -a ED -n "Department of Education" -i "distance learning challenges" -t education

# Integrate an enhanced use case
python3 integrate_enhanced_use_cases.py -a ED -e enhanced_agency_use_cases
```

## Workflow

1. **Issue Identification**: The system searches the web for real problems faced by the specified agency
2. **Issue Structuring**: It analyzes and structures the issues into a coherent format
3. **Solution Generation**: It develops solutions using HMS components that address the identified issues
4. **Use Case Enhancement**: It merges the issues and solutions with existing use cases
5. **Documentation Integration**: It integrates the enhanced use cases into the agency documentation

## Example

For the Department of Education (ED), the system might:

1. Identify issues related to "distance learning challenges" including digital divide, teacher training, and content quality
2. Structure these issues by stakeholders (students, teachers, administrators), limitations (internet access, devices), and political factors (funding, control)
3. Generate HMS solutions using components like HMS-GOV, HMS-MFE, and HMS-API
4. Enhance the existing ED use case with these real-world issues and solutions
5. Integrate the enhanced content into the ED documentation

## Testing

The enhancement system includes a comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Run all enhancement tests
./run_enhancement_tests.sh

# Run specific test modules
python3 -m test.test_agency_issue_enhancement
python3 -m test.test_pipeline_integration
python3 -m test.test_complete_workflow
```

## Integration with HMS Documentation Pipeline

The system is fully integrated with the HMS Documentation Pipeline. For more details on the integration, see [Pipeline Integration](../PIPELINE_INTEGRATION.md).
