# Chapter 15: Deployment & Rollback Orchestrator
*(‚ÄúMission-Control for every code launch‚Äù)*  

[‚Üê Back to Chapter 14: Data Governance & Privacy Guardrails](14_data_governance___privacy_guardrails_.md)

---

## 1. Why do we need a Mission-Control?

### The *‚ÄúFood-Delivery Licensing Rule‚Äù* story  

1. On Monday at 09:00 the Department of the Treasury publishes a new **‚ÄúInstant-Pay for cafeteria vendors‚Äù** rule.  
2. Treasury‚Äôs MFE, micro-services, and IAM scopes must all update at once.  
3. If the change blocks even **2 %** of legitimate payments, Congress demands a rollback **in minutes**, not days.

Without a **Deployment & Rollback Orchestrator (DRO)** we would:

* manually push containers,  
* eyeball metrics,  
* wake a war-room when KPIs dip.

With DRO we click **‚ÄúLaunch‚Äù**.  
It:

1. Spins up a **blue** (new) environment beside the **green** (live) one.  
2. Runs smoke tests + live KPIs from [Metrics & Observability Pipeline](12_metrics___observability_pipeline_.md).  
3. Shifts traffic gradually.  
4. Flips back automatically if anything smells burning.

Citizens keep ordering lunch; auditors keep peace of mind.

---

## 2. Key Concepts (rocket-launch analogies)

| DRO Term | Rocket Analogy | Plain meaning |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| Blueprint | Flight plan | YAML file that lists which images, configs, and tests make up the release. |
| Blue-Green | Two launchpads | Run new (**blue**) and old (**green**) versions side-by-side. |
| Smoke Test | ‚ÄúCan the engines ignite?‚Äù | Fast health check (e.g., `GET /healthz`). |
| Canary Slice | Small fuel injection | Route 1 % of real users to blue before full launch. |
| KPI Sentinel | Mission telemetry | Watches latency, error rate, revenue KPIs. |
| Rollback Switch | Abort handle | Instantly routes 100 % traffic back to green. |
| Promotion Gate | ‚ÄúGo/No-Go‚Äù call | Rule that must pass (tests, KPIs) before next phase. |

---

## 3. The 3-File Quick-Start

We‚Äôll ship **v2 of ‚ÄúFood-Delivery Licensing Service‚Äù** safely.

### 3.1 Blueprint (`deploy/foodsvc_v2.yaml`) ‚Äî *18 lines*

```yaml
id: foodsvc-v2
images:
  - svc: hms-svc-food    tag: "2.0.0"
  - mfe: food-delivery   tag: "2.0.0"
tests:
  - name: smoke
    cmd: curl -f http://blue.food-svc/healthz
kpi:
  error_rate: "< 0.5%"          # from Prometheus
  pay_success: "> 98%"
phases:
  - name: canary
    traffic: 1%
  - name: ramp-up
    traffic: 50%
  - name: full
    traffic: 100%
rollback: auto
```

What it says  
1. Which Docker tags to deploy.  
2. How to prove they‚Äôre healthy (`tests`, `kpi`).  
3. Traffic plan (1 % ‚Üí 50 % ‚Üí 100 %).  
4. If any test/KPI fails ‚Üí **auto rollback**.

---

### 3.2 One-line launch command

```bash
hms-deploy launch deploy/foodsvc_v2.yaml
```

(The CLI is a thin wrapper for the orchestrator‚Äôs API.)

### 3.3 Real-time status (terminal output)

```
‚òë Build images
‚òë Spin up blue pods (2/2 ready)
‚òë Smoke test PASS
‚Üí Shift 1% traffic ...  ‚úÖ KPIs steady
‚Üí Shift 50% traffic ... ‚ö†Ô∏è error_rate 0.7% > 0.5%
‚è™ Rolling back 100% traffic to green
üö® Rollback complete (took 45 s)
```

No pager needed; policy reverted before citizens notice.

## 4. Life of a Deployment ‚Äî Step-by-Step

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CLI as Dev CLI
    participant DRO as Orchestrator
    participant K8S as HMS-SYS Cluster
    participant MET as Metrics Sentinel
    participant BUS as Event Bus
    CLI->>DRO: upload blueprint
    DRO->>K8S: create blue resources
    DRO->>MET: start KPI watch
    K8S-->>DRO: health check PASS
    DRO->>K8S: shift traffic 1%
    MET-->>DRO: KPI breach ‚ùå
    DRO->>K8S: shift traffic back
    DRO-->>BUS: emit deployment.rolled_back
```

Only **five actors**, clear responsibility.

---

## 5. Peek Inside the Orchestrator

### 5.1 Minimal promotion loop (15 lines)

```python
# dro/promoter.py
import time, yaml, k8s, metrics

def promote(plan_file):
    p = yaml.safe_load(open(plan_file))
    for phase in p['phases']:
        k8s.shift_traffic(p['id'], phase['traffic'])   # ‚ë†
        if not wait_healthy(p, phase):
            rollback(p['id'])
            return
    print("üéâ Deployment complete")

def wait_healthy(p, phase, t=120):
    for _ in range(t):
        if all(metrics.check(k, v)             # ‚ë°
               for k, v in p.get('kpi', {}).items()):
            return True
        time.sleep(1)
    return False
```

Explanation  
‚ë† Uses Kubernetes label switch or Istio routing to move traffic.  
‚ë° `metrics.check()` queries Prometheus for the live KPI numbers.

### 5.2 Auto-rollback helper (10 lines)

```python
def rollback(release_id):
    k8s.shift_traffic(release_id, 0)     # route 0 % to blue
    bus.publish('deployment.rolled_back', {'id': release_id})
    print("‚è™ Rolled back")
```

The `deployment.rolled_back` event is picked up by:

* [HITL Console](04_human_in_the_loop__hitl__review_console_.md) ‚Üí shows red banner.  
* [Compliance & Audit Trail](13_compliance___audit_trail_.md) ‚Üí logs cause + hash chain.

## 6. Where It Touches Other HMS Layers

| Layer | Interaction |
|-------|-------------|
| [Metrics & Observability Pipeline](12_metrics___observability_pipeline_.md) | Supplies live KPIs to Sentinels. |
| [Core Infrastructure & Service Mesh (HMS-SYS)](11_core_infrastructure___service_mesh__hms_sys__.md) | Provides Kubernetes & Istio primitives (traffic shifting, health checks). |
| [Event Bus / Service Mesh](10_event_bus___service_mesh_.md) | Broadcasts `deployment.started`, `deployment.rolled_back` events. |
| [HITL Review Console](04_human_in_the_loop__hitl__review_console_.md) | Staff can *pause* or *resume* a rollout mid-flight. |
| [Policy/Process Engine](09_policy_process_engine_.md) | New versions of policies are often packaged in the same Blueprint. |

---

## 7. Hands-On Exercise (7 min)

1. Start the playground:

```bash
docker compose up dro k8s-sim prometheus grafana
```

2. Launch v2:

```bash
hms-deploy launch samples/foodsvc_v2.yaml
```

3. Watch Grafana panel ‚ÄúFoodSvc Error Rate‚Äù spike ‚Üí orchestrator auto-rolls back.  
4. Open the HITL console (`http://localhost:3000/hitl`) ‚Üí notice the automatic pause entry.  
5. Tail the audit trail:

```bash
tail -n1 logs/audit.log
# 2024-06-15T14:11Z  action:deployment.rolled_back  id:foodsvc-v2
```

Rollback certified!

## 8. Best-Practice Cheat-Sheet

| Do | Why |
|----|-----|
| Keep smoke tests **< 1 s** | Fast feedback shortens rollback window. |
| Watch **business KPIs**, not just 200/500 | A green `/healthz` can hide a revenue drop. |
| Store blueprint YAML in Git | Auditable change history. |
| Roll forward, not patch in place | Fixes mean a new blueprint (`v2.1`). |
| Emit events | Other layers (Governance, Audit) stay in sync. |

## 9. Common Questions

**Q: How is this different from GitHub Actions or ArgoCD?**  
Those tools *push bits*; DRO adds:

* KPI sentinels wired to [Metrics & Observability Pipeline](12_metrics___observability_pipeline_.md)  
* Built-in rollback logic  
* Tight coupling with HITL & Audit layers.

**Q: Can I force a rollback manually?**  
Yes‚Äîclick ‚ÄúAbort‚Äù in the [HITL Console](04_human_in_the_loop__hitl__review_console_.md) or run `hms-deploy abort <id>`.

**Q: How long do blue environments live after success?**  
Configurable. Default is 15 min for quick rollback, then garbage-collected.
