# Integration of HMS-ACH with OPPORTUNITY

This document outlines how the HMS-ACH (Health Management System – Automated Care Hub) component can integrate with and benefit the OPPORTUNITY mission. It covers:

1. Specific HMS-ACH capabilities aligned to OPPORTUNITY’s needs  
2. Technical integration approach (APIs, data flows, authentication)  
3. Stakeholder benefits and measurable improvements  
4. OPPORTUNITY-specific implementation considerations  
5. Illustrative use-case scenarios

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing OPPORTUNITY’s Mission

- **Unified Patient Records**  
  • Longitudinal clinical summaries (demographics, vitals, lab results)  
  • Offline data capture with automatic sync when connectivity resumes  

- **Automated Scheduling & Resource Allocation**  
  • Clinic and field-team rostering  
  • Equipment and supply tracking (stock levels, expiry alerts)  

- **Decision Support & Alerts**  
  • Rule-based clinical alerts (e.g., sepsis risk, medication contraindications)  
  • Customizable care pathways aligned with OPPORTUNITY protocols  

- **Analytics & Reporting**  
  • Real-time dashboards for case counts, bed utilization, reagent usage  
  • Exportable reports (PDF, CSV) for donor compliance and regulatory submissions  

- **Telehealth & Remote Monitoring**  
  • Secure video/audio consultations  
  • Integration with wearable devices for continuous vitals monitoring

## 2. Technical Integration Overview

### 2.1 APIs & Data Flows
- **RESTful FHIR APIs**  
  • Endpoints for Patient, Encounter, Observation, MedicationRequest  
  • JSON payloads conforming to HL7 FHIR R4 profiles  
- **Event Streaming**  
  • Kafka topics for real-time updates (e.g., new lab results, alert triggers)  
- **Batch Exports**  
  • SFTP/FTPS servers for nightly CSV or XML dumps (rostered patients, inventory statuses)

### 2.2 Authentication & Security
- **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect**  
  • Client credentials flow for server-to-server exchanges  
  • Authorization code flow for mobile/web user sessions  
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS)**  
  • Ensures endpoint authenticity for high-sensitivity exchanges  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  • Fine-grained permissions (read/write for clinicians, read-only for auditors)  
- **Data Encryption**  
  • At-rest: AES-256  
  • In-transit: TLS 1.2+  

### 2.3 Deployment & Infrastructure
- **Containerized Microservices**  
  • Docker images orchestrated via Kubernetes (on-premises or cloud)  
- **High Availability**  
  • Active/active database clusters  
  • Geo-redundant API gateways  
- **Interoperability Gateway**  
  • Mediates data mappings (local codes ↔ FHIR codes)  
  • Handles protocol translation (e.g., HL7 v2 ↔ FHIR)

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

| Stakeholder     | Benefit                                                  | Measure / KPI                         |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Field Clinicians| Faster patient registration & record retrieval           | ↓ Registration time (target: <2 min)  |
| Program Managers| Real-time visibility into resource utilization           | Utilization rate ↑ by 25%             |
| Supply Chain    | Automated low-stock alerts                                | Stock-out incidents ↓ by 40%          |
| Data Analysts   | Unified datasets for epidemiological reporting            | Report turnaround ↓ from 5 days → 1 day|
| Donors & Regulators | Transparent, audit-ready reporting                    | Compliance audit pass rate: 100%      |

## 4. OPPORTUNITY-Specific Implementation Considerations

- **Connectivity Constraints**  
  • Deploy edge nodes in low-bandwidth locations with data compression and store-&-forward mechanisms.  
- **Localization & Language**  
  • User interface translations (e.g., Spanish/French/local dialects)  
  • Date/time formats and measurement units customization  
- **Regulatory & Privacy**  
  • Align with local health data regulations (e.g., GDPR-equivalent, HIPAA-like frameworks)  
  • Implement consent management workflows per OPPORTUNITY’s policies  
- **Training & Change Management**  
  • Role-based eLearning modules for clinicians, logisticians, and administrators  
  • On-site “super-user” champions for peer support  
- **Scalability for Surge Events**  
  • Auto-scale container clusters during outbreak spikes  
  • Pre-configured triage workflows for mass-casualty or epidemic scenarios

## 5. Sample Use Cases

### 5.1 Remote Clinic Triage & Follow-Up
1. **Patient Check-In** via tablet running HMS-ACH offline module  
2. Encounter synced automatically when 3G connectivity returns  
3. Clinician reviews historical vitals and lab trends in FHIR viewer  
4. HMS-ACH triggers an alert for elevated fever patterns → orders rapid test  
5. Results flow back via HL7 integration → teleconsult scheduled  

### 5.2 Rapid Resource Reallocation During Outbreak
1. Surveillance data (case counts, locations) ingested to central dashboard  
2. Resource manager views heat-map and reallocates PPE and oxygen concentrators  
3. Automated purchase orders generated when stock < reorder threshold  
4. Delivery status updates streamed back into HMS-ACH for end-to-end visibility  

### 5.3 Donor Reporting & Compliance
1. Monthly KPIs auto-aggregated into a PDF report (case load, mortality rates)  
2. Data electronically signed and submitted via secure API to donor portal  
3. Audit trail logs all user actions and data exports for full transparency
