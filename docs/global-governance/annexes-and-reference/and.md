# HMS-ACH Integration with 

# Integration of HMS-ACH with AND

This document outlines how the HMS-ACH component of the Hospital Management System (HMS) can integrate with the Advanced Networked Defense (AND) program. It covers specific HMS-ACH capabilities, technical integration patterns, stakeholder benefits with metrics, AND-specific implementation considerations, and illustrative use cases.

## 1. HMS-ACH Capabilities Addressing AND’s Mission Needs

- **Real-Time Asset Discovery & Inventory**  
  • Auto-discover servers, endpoints and network devices in AND’s data centers and remote sites  
  • Maintain up-to-date configuration baselines for critical defense assets  
- **Continuous Vulnerability Assessment**  
  • Scheduled and on-demand vulnerability scans against NIST, DISA STIG, CIS benchmarks  
  • Risk-scoring engine to prioritize remediation for high-impact AND systems  
- **Automated Remediation Workflows**  
  • Pre-built playbooks for patch deployment, configuration drift correction, patch rollback  
  • Integration with AND change management to record all remediation events  
- **Event Correlation & Alerting**  
  • Ingest logs from firewalls, IDS/IPS, EDR and correlate with host-level events  
  • Rule-based and machine-learning driven alerts for suspicious behavior on mission-critical nodes  
- **Reporting & Dashboards**  
  • Custom AND-branded dashboards showing compliance posture, open findings, trends  
  • Exportable reports for leadership review and Joint Staff audits

## 2. Technical Integration Architecture

1. **APIs & Data Flows**  
   - HMS-ACH exposes RESTful endpoints over HTTPS (JSON/XML payloads).  
   - AND systems push asset metadata and event logs via POST /api/v1/and/assets  
   - HMS-ACH returns vulnerability findings via GET /api/v1/and/findings  
   - Webhooks notify AND of critical alerts (HTTP callback)  

2. **Authentication & Authorization**  
   - OAuth2.0 Client Credentials grant for machine-to-machine access  
   - TLS mutual authentication (mTLS) for all API calls  
   - RBAC in HMS-ACH enforces per-role (e.g., AND-Operator, AND-Inspector) permissions  

3. **Data Synchronization**  
   - Bi-directional sync every 15 minutes by default; configurable to real-time on high-priority segments  
   - Message bus (e.g., Kafka) for event-streaming: HMS-ACH publishes remediation events, AND subscribes  

4. **Network Considerations**  
   - Integration endpoints sit in DMZ with firewall rules restricting to AND’s egress IPs  
   - Compressed, encrypted payloads (gzip over TLS) to minimize bandwidth on tactical networks

## 3. Benefits & Measurable Improvements

- **Improved Situational Awareness**  
  • 100% inventory coverage of AND-managed hosts within 24 hrs of deployment  
- **Faster Threat Detection & Response**  
  • Reduction of Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) from ~2 hrs to <15 mins for high-severity events  
  • Reduction of Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR) by up to 50% via automated playbooks  
- **Compliance & Audit Readiness**  
  • 98% continuous compliance against DISA STIG checks  
  • Automated evidence collection reduces manual audit preparation time by 70%  
- **Operational Efficiency**  
  • 30% fewer manual ticket escalations thanks to pre-built AND workflows  
  • Centralized dashboard cuts weekly status meeting prep by 3 hours

## 4. Implementation Considerations Specific to AND

- **Security & Accreditation**  
  • Align with AND’s RMF (Risk Management Framework) phases: categorize, select, implement, assess  
  • Obtain Authority to Operate (ATO) on Mil-Cloud or AND’s IL-5 enclave  
- **Data Classification & Handling**  
  • Segregate CUI and classified data—HMS-ACH enforces labelled data partitions  
  • FIPS 140-2 validated cryptography for all stored and in-transit data  
- **Network Topology Constraints**  
  • Support air-gapped and limited bandwidth environments—store-and-forward buffer  
  • Hardened virtual appliances for forward deployment aboard ships and mobile HQs  
- **Operational Training & Change Management**  
  • Role-based training packages for AND operators, SOC analysts, and system administrators  
  • Phased rollout: pilot at one brigade, then enterprise-wide deployment

## 5. Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Rapid Remediation of a Critical Vulnerability  
1. AND’s scanning engine reports CVE-2024-XXXX on a mission server.  
2. HMS-ACH automatically ingests the finding and matches to the “High-Priority Defense” playbook.  
3. A patch job is scheduled via HMS-ACH API, executed after AND-Operator approval.  
4. Post-installation, HMS-ACH re-scans and confirms remediation; updates AND dashboard.

### Use Case 2: Coordinated Incident Response  
1. An IDS alerts on anomalous lateral movement in a secure enclave.  
2. HMS-ACH correlates host logs and flags the compromised endpoint.  
3. A webhook triggers AND’s SOAR platform; automated containment isolates the node.  
4. Remediation results and chain-of-custody reports propagate back to HMS-ACH for audit.

### Use Case 3: Continuous Compliance Monitoring  
1. HMS-ACH syncs nightly with AND’s CMDB for asset updates.  
2. DISA STIG compliance scans run weekly; results populate the AND-specific compliance dashboard.  
3. Any drift triggers a Jira ticket in AND’s ITSM system via API integration.  
4. ITSM workflow tracks remediation progress; final closure logged in HMS-ACH.

By leveraging HMS-ACH’s advanced discovery, assessment, and automation capabilities—and tightly integrating via secure APIs—AND gains real-time visibility, faster response, and measurable improvements in security posture and operational efficiency.
