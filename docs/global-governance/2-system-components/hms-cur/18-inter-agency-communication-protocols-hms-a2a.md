## 1  Why Do We Need A2A?

### Central use-case ‚Äì ‚ÄúSend Disability Status From Social Security ‚Üí Veterans Affairs‚Äù

1. Every night the **Social Security Administration (SSA)** produces a file:  
   `new_disability_awards_2024-06-10.csv`.
2. The **Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)** must ingest it before 06:00 so disabled vets automatically see benefit increases.
3. If the file is tampered with‚Äîor even just chopped in half‚Äî40 000 veterans may get the wrong check.

**HMS-A2A** is the *sealed diplomatic pouch* between agencies:

* Ensures the file is **signed, encrypted, and schema-validated**.
* Delivers an automatic **acknowledgment (ACK)** or **negative acknowledgment (NACK)**.
* Stores a **tamper-proof receipt** for auditors (‚ÄúSSA sent v3, VA accepted at 05:02, hash abc123‚Ä¶‚Äù).

No more lost CDs, no more ‚ÄúDid you get my e-mail?‚Äù phone calls.

## 2  Key Concepts (Plain-English Glossary)

| A2A Term           | Beginner-Friendly Meaning                                                |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Secure Envelope    | JSON wrapper that holds the payload plus a SHA-256 hash and signature.    |
| Schema Registry    | Central folder of `.json` files that define the shape of each message.    |
| ACK / NACK         | One-line reply: **ACK** = ‚ÄúI got it & it‚Äôs valid‚Äù, **NACK** = ‚Äúbad schema‚Äù.|
| Retry Token        | UUID that lets the sender safely re-send the same envelope once.          |
| Audit Receipt      | Signed proof, stored in DTA, that both sides can show Congress later.     |

## 3  Sending Tonight‚Äôs Disability File ‚Äì 15 Lines Each Side

### 3.1 Sender (SSA) ‚Äì `ssa_send.py`

```python
import json, gzip, base64, uuid, requests, hashlib

raw = open("new_disability_awards.csv","rb").read()
payload = base64.b64encode(gzip.compress(raw)).decode()
env = {
  "id": uuid.uuid4().hex,
  "type": "ssa.disability_award.v3",
  "payload": payload,
  "sha256": hashlib.sha256(raw).hexdigest()
}
r = requests.post("https://a2a.gov/send", json=env,
                  headers={"X-Agency":"SSA"})
print(r.json())                 # ‚ûú {'ack':'accepted'}
```

‚Ä¢ Compresses & base-64s the file.  
‚Ä¢ Adds `sha256` so the receiver can verify integrity.  
‚Ä¢ One POST, done.

### 3.2 Receiver (VA) ‚Äì `va_server.py` (18 lines)

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Request
import json, gzip, base64, hashlib, pathlib, uuid

app = FastAPI(); PATH = pathlib.Path("inbox"); PATH.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

@app.post("/send")
async def receive(req: Request):
    env = await req.json()
    schema_ok = env["type"] == "ssa.disability_award.v3"
    if not schema_ok:
        return {"ack":"NACK","reason":"wrong schema"}

    raw = gzip.decompress(base64.b64decode(env["payload"]))
    if hashlib.sha256(raw).hexdigest() != env["sha256"]:
        return {"ack":"NACK","reason":"hash mismatch"}

    fn = PATH / f"{env['id']}.csv"
    fn.write_bytes(raw)
    log_receipt(env, "accepted")        # see below
    return {"ack":"accepted"}
```

The VA server:

1. Checks the **schema id**.  
2. Verifies the **hash**.  
3. Saves the CSV and writes a receipt.

*(`log_receipt` is 3 lines: append JSON to `receipts.jsonl`.)*

## 4  Under the Hood ‚Äì What Actually Happens?

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SSA as Social Security
    participant G1 as A2A Gateway
    participant VA as Veterans Affairs
    participant AUD as Audit Log

    SSA->>G1: envelope (csv+hash)
    G1->>VA: forward if signature valid
    VA-->>G1: ACK / NACK
    G1->>SSA: relay ACK / NACK
    G1->>AUD: store signed receipt
```

Only **four** moving parts‚Äîeasy to reason about.

## 5  Inside A2A Gateway (Folder Peek)

```
hms-a2a/
 ‚îú‚îÄ gateway.py
 ‚îú‚îÄ schemas/
 ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ ssa.disability_award.v3.json
 ‚îú‚îÄ receipts/
 ‚îî‚îÄ keys/
```

### 5.1 Gateway Core (19 Lines)

```python
# gateway.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
import jsonschema, json, uuid, pathlib, requests

app = FastAPI(); R = pathlib.Path("receipts"); R.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
SCHEMAS = {p.stem: json.load(open(p)) for p in pathlib.Path("schemas").glob("*.json")}

@app.post("/send")
async def route(req: Request):
    env = await req.json()
    typ = env["type"]
    if typ not in SCHEMAS:
        return {"ack":"NACK","reason":"unknown type"}
    try:
        jsonschema.validate(env, SCHEMAS[typ])
    except jsonschema.ValidationError as e:
        return {"ack":"NACK","reason":"schema fail"}

    dest = "https://va.gov/send" if typ.startswith("ssa.") else None
    ack = requests.post(dest, json=env, timeout=5).json()
    receipt = {**env, **ack, "gateway_id": uuid.uuid4().hex}
    (R/f"{receipt['gateway_id']}.json").write_text(json.dumps(receipt))
    return ack
```

‚Ä¢ Validates against the **Schema Registry**.  
‚Ä¢ Forwards to the correct agency URL.  
‚Ä¢ Saves a **receipt** no matter what.

## 6  How A2A Fits With Other Layers

| Layer | Interaction |
|-------|-------------|
| [Governance Layer](01_governance_layer__hms_gov__.md) | External callers hit **HMS-GOV** ‚ûú it proxies to A2A if the target is another agency. |
| [Policy Engine (HMS-CDF)](02_policy_engine__hms_cdf__.md) | Decides which schema versions are allowed and enforces size limits. |
| [Secure Data Repository (HMS-DTA)](13_secure_data_repository__hms_dta__.md) | Stores the **receipts** folder immutably. |
| [Monitoring & Observability](14_monitoring___observability__hms_ops__.md) | Tracks ‚Äúa2a_latency_ms‚Äù and ‚Äúnack_rate‚Äù. |
| [External System Sync](17_external_system_synchronization_.md) | Uses A2A to broadcast large event files across agencies. |

## 7  Hands-On Mini Lab

1. Run the VA receiver:

```bash
uvicorn va_server:app --port 9001 --reload
```

2. Run the A2A gateway:

```bash
uvicorn gateway:app --port 9000 --reload
```

3. Send the file (`python ssa_send.py`).  
4. Open `receipts/`‚Äîyou‚Äôll see a JSON proof like:

```json
{"id":"a1b2","type":"ssa.disability_award.v3","ack":"accepted", ...}
```

5. Corrupt the hash in `ssa_send.py` and resend‚Äîobserve the **NACK** reply and matching receipt.

## 8  Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I roll out a new schema version?**  
Publish `ssa.disability_award.v4.json` to the **Schema Registry**; the Policy Engine can run both v3 and v4 in parallel during migration.

**Q: What if the receiver is down?**  
The gateway queues the envelope and retries. After N failures it returns `NACK: destination unreachable` and alerts OPS.

**Q: Is the data encrypted?**  
Yes‚Äîin production the ‚Äúpayload‚Äù field is already PGP-encrypted with the receiver‚Äôs public key before base-64 encoding.

## 9  What You Learned

* HMS-A2A is the *sealed diplomatic pouch* between agencies.  
* Every envelope carries its own **schema id**, **hash**, and **signature**.  
* A two-line **ACK/NACK** protocol gives instant feedback; receipts make audits painless.  
* Less than 20 lines per component are enough to grasp the whole flow.

### üéâ Congratulations‚ÄîYou‚Äôve Reached the End of the Core HMS-CUR Layers!

You now have:

1. A front door (HMS-GOV).  
2. Guardrails (policy & legal).  
3. Agents, workflows, data vaults, monitoring, payments‚Ä¶  
4. And finally, a secure **inter-agency courier**.

Go forth and build public-sector software that citizens actually **trust**!
