# Chapter 11: Intent-Driven Navigation & Guided Journeys  
*(‚ÄúStop Guessing Forms‚ÄîJust Say What You Need‚Äù)*

## 1. Motivation ‚Äî The ‚ÄúI Just Moved‚Äù Story  

Mario, a recently-relocated veteran, visits **gov.services** to update his address.  

Today‚Äôs reality:

1. He sees **12** different ‚ÄúChange of Address‚Äù links‚ÄîVA, IRS, USPS, Medicare ‚Ä¶  
2. He guesses the VA form, fills 20 fields already in the system, and still misses the Medicare one.  
3. Two months later benefit checks go to the old house. ‚òπÔ∏è  

Intent-Driven Navigation flips the script:  

> Website: ‚ÄúHi Mario! **What are you trying to do?**‚Äù  
> Mario: ‚ÄúI moved and need everything updated.‚Äù  
> Website: ‚ÄúGreat‚Äîhere are the agencies affected. I‚Äôll pre-fill what we know and walk you through the 3-step journey.‚Äù

No hunting, no duplicates, no missed benefits.

## 2. Why Classic Menus Fail

| Classic Menu | Intent-Driven |
|--------------|---------------|
| User hunts for the right form | User states goal in plain language |
| 5‚Äì10 clicks before first question | 1 click ‚Üí ‚ÄúWhat do you need?‚Äù |
| Data re-entered for every form | Known data auto-prefilled |
| Staff must glue partial submissions | Platform orchestrates full journey |

Result: happier citizens **and** lighter workloads for agency staff.

## 3. Key Concepts (Beginner-Friendly)

| Word | 1-Line Meaning | Analogy |
|------|---------------|---------|
| Intent Question | ‚ÄúWhat are you trying to do?‚Äù prompt | Concierge asking purpose of visit |
| Intent Classifier | Tiny AI that maps free-text ‚Üí goal label (`address_change`) | Concierge‚Äôs mental lookup |
| Journey Blueprint | YAML file listing steps & micro-services for that goal | Printed DMV route map |
| Step Engine | Code that executes steps in order | Escort walking you window-to-window |
| Smart Prefill | Fetch & inject known data (`name`, `address`) | Clerk filling half the form for you |
| Context Token | Small JSON carried between steps to avoid re-asks | Passport you show at each window |

## 4. ‚ÄúHello Journey‚Äù in 3 Tiny Steps  

We‚Äôll build a minimal journey for `address_change`.

### 4.1 Draft the Journey Blueprint (YAML ‚â§ 15 lines)

```yaml
# file: blueprints/address_change.yml
id: address_change
steps:
  - id: confirm_identity   # VA Auth svc
    service: identity-service
  - id: update_medicare
    service: medicare-address-svc
  - id: update_va
    service: va-address-svc
prefill_fields: [ first_name, last_name, ssn, old_address ]
```

Explanation  
‚Ä¢ `steps` list where Mario must go.  
‚Ä¢ `prefill_fields` tells the engine which data to inject automatically.

---

### 4.2 Ask for Intent (Front-End, React ‚â§ 15 lines)

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import api from "../utils/api";           // same tiny hook from Ch.10

export default function WhatDoYouNeed() {
  const [text, setText] = useState("");

  async function send() {
    const { journey_id } = await api.post("/intent", { text });
    window.location = `/journey/${journey_id}`; // start!
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>What do you need today?</h1>
      <textarea onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={send}>Go</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

User types ‚ÄúI moved last week‚Äù ‚Üí API returns `address_change`.

---

### 4.3 Run the Journey (Server ‚â§ 18 lines)

```python
# file: journey_engine.py
import yaml, requests

BLUEPRINTS = {b['id']: b for b in
              map(yaml.safe_load,
                  open("blueprints/address_change.yml").read().split("---"))
             }

def run(journey_id, context):
    bp = BLUEPRINTS[journey_id]
    for step in bp["steps"]:
        svc = step["service"]
        payload = {**context, "step_id": step["id"]}
        # Always call through Gateway
        r = requests.post(f"https://api.gov/{svc}/handle", json=payload)
        context.update(r.json())          # add new data
    return context        # final status / receipt
```

‚Ä¢ `context` starts with prefilled data from user profile.  
‚Ä¢ Each micro-service returns any extra info (e.g., new address ID).  
‚Ä¢ Engine chains them‚Äîone call per step.

---

## 5. What Happens Under the Hood?

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant UI as Portal
participant INT as Intent Svc
participant ENG as Journey Engine
participant S1 as identity-service
participant S2 as medicare-address-svc

UI->>INT: "I moved last week"
INT-->>UI: journey_id=address_change
UI->>ENG: start journey
ENG->>S1: confirm_identity
S1-->>ENG: ok + user_id
ENG->>S2: update_medicare
S2-->>ENG: ok
ENG-->>UI: üéâ Journey complete
```

Only **one question** to the user; the engine does the rest.

---

## 6. Inside the Intent Classifier (‚â§ 20 lines)

```python
# file: intent_classifier.py
import re

RULES = {
  "address_change": r"\b(move|moved|new address|change.*address)\b",
  "lost_id":        r"\b(lost|stolen).*id\b"
}

def classify(text):
    for intent, pattern in RULES.items():
        if re.search(pattern, text, flags=re.I):
            return intent
    return "fallback_help"
```

In production the matcher could be an ML model; here a few regexes show the idea.

---

## 7. Folder Peek

```
hms-intent/
 ‚îú‚îÄ intent_classifier.py
 ‚îú‚îÄ journey_engine.py
 ‚îî‚îÄ blueprints/
     ‚îî‚îÄ address_change.yml
```

All under 50 LOC, yet fully functional.

## 8. How It Connects to Other Layers

| Layer | Interaction |
|-------|-------------|
| [Interface Layer](10_interface_layer__hms_mfe__hms_gov_portals__.md) | Shows intent box, renders progress UI. |
| [Backend API Gateway](07_backend_api_gateway__hms_api__.md) | Engine calls each step *through* the Gateway. |
| [Microservice Mesh](06_microservice_mesh___service_discovery_.md) | Step services scale & secure traffic. |
| [Data Privacy Engine](03_data_privacy___compliance_engine_.md) | Prefill removes PII not needed for a step. |
| [HITL Override](15_human_in_the_loop__hitl__override_.md) | Humans can pause a journey mid-flow for review. |

Governance and RBAC checks apply to blueprints just like any other policy.

## 9. Tips & Gotchas

1. **Keep Prompts Short.** ‚ÄúWhat do you need?‚Äù outperforms multi-paragraph instructions.  
2. **Version Blueprints.** `address_change@v2` can add steps without breaking v1 journeys in progress.  
3. **Graceful Fallback.** If classifier confidence is low, route to live chat‚Äînot a random form.  
4. **Prefill Carefully.** Only inject data each micro-service is allowed to see (privacy!).  
5. **Show Progress.** A simple breadcrumb (`1 / 3 steps done`) calms nervous users.

## 10. Recap & Up Next

You learned how HMS-MCP:

1. Asks *one* natural-language question,  
2. Classifies intent,  
3. Runs a pre-defined journey,  
4. Prefills known data,  
5. Completes multi-agency tasks with near zero user confusion.

Next we‚Äôll meet the **AI Representative Agent (HMS-A2A)** that can *talk for the user* during these journeys, even when they step away from the screen.
