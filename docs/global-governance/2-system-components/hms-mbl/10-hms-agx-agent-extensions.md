# Chapter 10: HMS-AGX  (Agent Extensions)

*[Jumped in here first? Peek at the ‚ÄúHR desk for bots‚Äù in  
[Chapter 9 ‚Äì HMS-AGT  (Core Agent Framework)](09_hms_agt___core_agent_framework__.md) to learn how agents get hired and badged.)*

## 1. Why Do Agents Need ‚ÄúGear‚Äù?

Use-case story:

> A new wildfire erupts near a national forest.  
>  ‚Ä¢ DOI (Interior) owns the land maps.  
>  ‚Ä¢ USDA Forest Service flies drones for live images.  
>  ‚Ä¢ FEMA controls public-safety alerts.  
>   
>  A single **Response-Planner agent** must:  
>  1. read plain-English incident reports,  
>  2. label hot spots on drone photos,  
>  3. update FEMA‚Äôs alert feed in real time.  

The agent already has a **badge** (HMS-AGT) but still lacks the *gear* to read images or post to FEMA.  
Enter **HMS-AGX**‚Äîa backpack of optional toolkits that instantly upgrade any certified agent.

Think of HMS-AGT as ‚Äúbasic training‚Äù and HMS-AGX as the **special-forces supply room**.

## 2. High-Level Picture

```mermaid

  AGT["ü§ñ Agent (core)"] -->|plugs in| AGX["üéí AGX Gear Pack"]
  AGX --> DOI["üó∫Ô∏è Map API (DOI)"]
  AGX --> USDA["üì∑ Drone Image Feed (USDA)"]
  AGX --> FEMA["üì¢ Alert Channel (FEMA)"]
```

The same agent code stays tiny; the pack handles every exotic skill.

## 3. Key Concepts (one-by-one)

| AGX Term           | Beginner Analogy                  | Meaning in HMS-AGX                                   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Extension Pack** | Add-on lens for a camera          | A container + manifest providing one new capability  |
| **Load-out**       | Soldier‚Äôs backpack list           | Set of packs an agent must load before a mission     |
| **Capability**     | ‚ÄúNight-vision‚Äù, ‚ÄúSnow tires‚Äù      | Named function (e.g., `image.detect_hotspots`)       |
| **Scope Token**    | Rental key for one room           | Limited JWT each pack uses to reach external APIs    |
| **AGX Registry**   | Weapon locker inventory           | Catalog where packs are published & versioned        |

## 4. Installing Gear ‚Äì 3 Micro-Steps

We‚Äôll give **Response-Planner** two packs:

1. `vision-kit` ‚Äì labels fire in images.  
2. `fema-sync` ‚Äì pushes JSON alerts to FEMA.

### 4.1 Pick Packs From the Registry (CLI, 1 line)

```bash
hms agx search wildfire   # shows vision-kit 1.2, fema-sync 2.0 ‚Ä¶
```

### 4.2 Declare a Load-out in the Agent Manifest (‚â§ 10 lines)

```yaml
# snippet added to response_planner.manifest.yml
loadout:
  - vision-kit@1.2
  - fema-sync@2.0
```

### 4.3 Re-register the Agent

```bash
hms agt update response_planner.manifest.yml
# AGT output:
# ‚úî Fetched packs (vision-kit, fema-sync)
# ‚úî Issued scope tokens for DOI/USDA/FEMA
```

The agent may start its next job **unchanged**; packs inject themselves at runtime.

## 5. Using a Capability ‚Äì Tiny Code Example (18 lines)

```python
# file: response_planner.py
from agx import load_capability   # AGX helper SDK ‚â§ 20 lines internally

detect = load_capability("image.detect_hotspots")   # from vision-kit
push   = load_capability("fema.alert.push")         # from fema-sync

def handle_drone_frame(frame_jpg: bytes):
    hotspots = detect(frame_jpg)        # returns list[(lat,lon)]
    if hotspots:
        push({"type":"wildfire", "points":hotspots})
```

Explanation:  
‚Ä¢ `load_capability()` looks up the pack, verifies scope, and returns a function pointer.  
‚Ä¢ The agent code stays as short as a postcard.

## 6. What Happens Under the Hood?

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant OMS as HMS-OMS
  participant AG as Agent
  participant AGX as AGX Loader
  participant EXT as Extension Pack
  OMS->>AG: assign job
  AG->>AGX: need "image.detect_hotspots"
  AGX->>EXT: fetch + sandbox
  EXT-->>AG: callable fn
  AG->>OMS: task complete
```

Only 4 extra steps‚Äîautomated & logged.

---

## 7. Peeking Inside AGX (Code-Light)

### 7.1 Extension Manifest (vision-kit, 12 lines)

```yaml
id: vision-kit
version: 1.2.0
capabilities:
  image.detect_hotspots:
    entry: detect.py
    scopes: [ "s3://usda-drone/*" ]
runtime: "python3.11"
```

### 7.2 AGX Loader (abbrev., 15 lines)

```python
# file: agx/loader.py
import importlib, json, pathlib

def load_capability(name):
    pkg, cap = name.split(".",1)
    path = pathlib.Path(f"/packs/{pkg}/cap_{cap}.py")
    mod  = importlib.machinery.SourceFileLoader(cap, path).load_module()
    return getattr(mod, "handler")       # every cap exposes handler()
```

### 7.3 Scope Token Injector (pseudo, 10 lines)

```python
def sandbox(fn, scopes):
    token = agt.issue_scope(scopes)      # short-lived JWT
    def wrapped(*a, **kw):
        os.environ["SCOPE_JWT"] = token
        return fn(*a, **kw)
    return wrapped
```

The caller never handles tokens directly; security is invisible.

## 8. Common Beginner Questions

| Question | Quick Fix |
|----------|-----------|
| ‚ÄúMy agent crashes: ‚Äòcapability not found‚Äô‚Äù | Run `hms agx list agent-id` to verify the pack version is loaded. |
| ‚ÄúCan two packs collide?‚Äù | AGX mounts each pack in its own namespace; use fully-qualified names. |
| ‚ÄúHow do I publish my own pack?‚Äù | `hms agx publish my-pack/manifest.yml` (scans go through HMS-ESQ). |

## 9. How AGX Fits With Other HMS Pieces

```mermaid
graph TD
  AGX["üéí HMS-AGX"] --> AGT["ü§ñ HMS-AGT"]
  AGX --> OMS["üõ´ HMS-OMS"]
  AGX --> MKT["üè¨ HMS-MKT"]
  AGX --> ESQ["üõ°Ô∏è HMS-ESQ"]
```

‚Ä¢ Packs are **listed** in the Marketplace (HMS-MKT).  
‚Ä¢ Security & license scans run in **HMS-ESQ**.  
‚Ä¢ When OMS assigns work, AGT injects the required load-out through AGX.  

---

## 10. Hands-On Recap

You learned how to:

1. **Search & install** ready-made gear packs.  
2. Add a **10-line load-out** to an agent manifest.  
3. Call new capabilities with a **one-line helper**.  
4. Peeked inside AGX‚Äôs tiny loader and sandbox.  

Your agents are now battle-ready for advanced missions!

## 11. What‚Äôs Next?

Gear is powerful, but agents still need a **shared language** to describe the real-world context they work in‚Äîprompts, provenance, and safety rails.  
That language is the **Model Context Protocol** covered in  
[HMS-MCP  (Model Context Protocol)](11_hms_mcp___model_context_protocol__.md).
