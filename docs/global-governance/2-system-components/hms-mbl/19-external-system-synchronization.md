# Chapter 19: External System Synchronization

*(Coming from [Security, Compliance & Legal Reasoning (HMS-ESQ)](18_security__compliance___legal_reasoning__hms_esq__.md) where we learned how every HMS message is checked before leaving the house.  Today we cross the **cloud boundary** and make sure outside partners actually **receive** our updates‚Äîwithin seconds, not weeks.)*

## 1. Why Do We Need a ‚ÄúTranslation Booth‚Äù?

### Story ‚Äî *Zoning Permit Ping-Pong*

1. **Alex** submits a zoning-permit application in his city‚Äôs shiny HMS portal.  
2. The city must also alert the **State DMV** (heavy-truck traffic study) and the **County Tax Office** (property-value reassessment).  
3. Those external systems are 1990s mainframes. If HMS just *e-mails* them, staff will manually type the data next Thursday.  
4. With **External System Synchronization (ESS)** HMS pushes an event; **connectors** translate it into the exact COBOL record or SOAP call the mainframe expects‚Äî**within 5 seconds**.  
5. Alex sees *‚ÄúAll agencies notified‚Äù* on his dashboard the same minute.

No manual re-keying, no week-long lag.

## 2. Key Concepts (one-by-one)

| Friendly Nickname | ESS Term | What It Means |
|-------------------|----------|---------------|
| Plug Adapter | **Connector** | Tiny service that turns an HMS event into the target system‚Äôs dialect. |
| Packing Slip | **Manifest** | YAML file declaring *what* to send and *where*. |
| Tick-Tock | **Heartbeat** | ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alive‚Äù ping‚Äîops can page if a connector dies. |
| Change List | **Delta Feed** | Only the fields that changed (saves bandwidth). |
| Time Machine | **Replay Window** | Buffer that can resend last N minutes if partner was down. |

> If HMS-OPS is our ‚ÄúNORAD,‚Äù ESS connectors are the **radios** that let NORAD talk to older outposts.

## 3. 3-File ‚ÄúHello Connector‚Äù (City ‚Üí State DMV)

We will:

1. Declare a manifest,  
2. Write a 15-line connector,  
3. Watch HMS push a delta feed.

### 3.1 Manifest (‚â§ 10 lines)

```yaml
# dmv_manifest.yml
id: city2dmv
listen_topic: "permits.changed"
target_url:  "https://dmv.state.gov/soap/permits"
fields: ["permit_id","street","truck_limit"]
heartbeat_sec: 30
```

*Explanation*  
‚Ä¢ Listen to internal event `permits.changed`.  
‚Ä¢ Forward only three fields to the DMV SOAP endpoint.  
‚Ä¢ Send a heartbeat every 30 s so OPS can alert if it stops.

### 3.2 Connector Code (15 lines)

```python
# city2dmv.py
import httpx, json, os, time, pika

BUS = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.URLParameters(os.getenv("BUS_URL")))
CH  = BUS.channel()
TARGET = os.getenv("TARGET_URL")

def to_soap(payload):
    # 1-line XML wrapper (real life needs full schema)
    return f"<Permit><ID>{payload['permit_id']}</ID></Permit>"

def on_msg(ch, mthd, prop, body):
    data = json.loads(body)
    xml  = to_soap(data)
    httpx.post(TARGET, data=xml, timeout=5)

CH.basic_consume("permits.changed", on_msg, auto_ack=True)

while True:          # heartbeat loop
    httpx.post(f"{TARGET}/ping")
    time.sleep(30)
```

*What happens?*  
1. Connector listens to the HMS event bus.  
2. Converts JSON ‚Üí minimal XML.  
3. Posts to DMV; sends ‚Äú/ping‚Äù every 30 s.

### 3.3 Emit a Delta Feed (HMS side, 12 lines)

```python
# when a permit changes inside HMS
import pika, json, os
bus = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.URLParameters(os.getenv("BUS_URL")))
ch  = bus.channel()

delta = {"permit_id":"P-778", "street":"Main St", "truck_limit":5}
ch.basic_publish(exchange="hms.events", routing_key="permits.changed",
                 body=json.dumps(delta))
```

*Within seconds the DMV mainframe receives `<Permit><ID>P-778</ID></Permit>`.*

---

## 4. What Happens Under the Hood?

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant HMS as HMS Event Bus
  participant CON as city2dmv Connector
  participant DMV as DMV Mainframe
  participant OPS as HMS-OPS
  HMS->>CON: JSON delta
  CON->>DMV: SOAP XML
  DMV-->>CON: 200 OK
  CON->>OPS: heartbeat metric
```

1. HMS publishes a delta.  
2. Connector translates & posts.  
3. Success/fail & heartbeat are logged in OPS.

---

## 5. Inside ESS (Code-Light Peek)

### 5.1 Offsets Table (SQLite, 8 lines)

```sql
CREATE TABLE sync_offsets (
  topic      TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  last_ts    DATETIME        -- last event sent
);
```

‚Ä¢ Protects against duplicate sends; replay starts from `last_ts`.

### 5.2 Replay Job (‚â§ 16 lines)

```python
# replay.py
import sqlite3, time, httpx, json
DB = sqlite3.connect("ess.db")
while True:
    for topic, last in DB.execute("SELECT topic,last_ts FROM sync_offsets"):
        events = bus.fetch_since(topic, last)   # pseudo helper
        for ev in events:
            httpx.post(TARGET, data=to_soap(ev))
            DB.execute("UPDATE sync_offsets SET last_ts=? WHERE topic=?", (ev["ts"], topic))
    time.sleep(60)
```

If DMV was offline for 30 min, replay resends missed events automatically.

## 6. Where ESS Fits in the HMS House

```mermaid
graph TD
  ESS["üîÑ ESS Connectors"] --> BUS["üöå Event Bus"]  %% Chapter 3
  ESS --> OPS["üî≠ HMS-OPS"]                         %% heartbeats
  ESS --> ESQ["üõ°Ô∏è HMS-ESQ"]                         %% scans outgoing
  ESS --> MCP["ü§ù HMS-MCP"]                         %% envelopes if PHI
```

* Connectors **subscribe** to the event bus you built in [HMS Micro-services Backbone](03_hms_micro_services_backbone_.md).  
* Every outgoing payload is first checked by **HMS-ESQ** (legal).  
* Heartbeats & failures show up as `ess_connector_up` in **HMS-OPS** dashboards.  
* Sensitive data rides in an [MCP envelope](11_hms_mcp___model_context_protocol__.md) so consent & provenance follow it.

## 7. Common Beginner Questions

| Question | Quick Fix |
|----------|-----------|
| ‚ÄúConnector floods the partner.‚Äù | Add `debounce_sec` in the manifest; ESS will merge rapid changes. |
| ‚ÄúDMV endpoint times out.‚Äù | ESS automatically retries with back-off; tune `max_retry` in manifest. |
| ‚ÄúNeed bi-directional sync.‚Äù | Deploy a **reverse connector** from DMV ‚Üí HMS using the same pattern. |
| ‚ÄúHow do I push huge files?‚Äù | Ship a signed HMS-DTA URL inside the event; connector only passes the link. |

---

## 8. Hands-On Checklist

1. Write a **manifest** (‚â§ 10 lines).  
2. Code a **connector** (‚â§ 20 lines) ‚Üí drop into `connectors/`.  
3. Run `hms ess deploy city2dmv` ‚Üí CI wires heartbeats & retries.  
4. Watch the **OPS dashboard** light up green boxes for every heartbeat.  
5. Toggle DMV endpoint off, verify replay after it comes back.
