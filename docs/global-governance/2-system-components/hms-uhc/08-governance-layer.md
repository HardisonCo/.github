# Chapter 8: Governance Layer

In [Chapter 7: AI Governance Model](07_ai_governance_model_.md) we saw how to guard individual AI recommendations. Now it’s time to widen our scope: the **Governance Layer** sits above every service—data storage, AI agents, APIs—to enforce transparency, ethics, safety, and privacy across the whole platform. Think of it as a city council making sure every department follows the same rules.

---

## 1. Why We Need a Governance Layer

Imagine the Office of Energy Efficiency (OEE) running a public “Building Energy Data” portal. Citizens, researchers, and utilities request energy‐use data. The Governance Layer ensures:

- Only approved user roles can fetch detailed records.  
- Personally identifiable details are anonymized.  
- Every request is logged for audit.  
- Changes to sharing rules flow through a consistent, transparent process.

Without this layer, each service would roll its own checks—resulting in gaps, inconsistent enforcement, and audit headaches.

---

## 2. Key Concepts

1. **Policy Registry**  
   A central store of rules (e.g., who can access which data).

2. **Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)**  
   The “checkpoint” code in each request path that loads and applies policies.

3. **Compliance Checker**  
   Runs the policy logic against incoming requests or data outputs.

4. **Audit Log**  
   An immutable record of every decision (who asked, which rule fired, allowed or denied).

---

## 3. Using the Governance Layer: A Simple Energy Data Example

### 3.1 Client Side: Requesting Energy Data

```js
// File: client.js
import api from './api';  // fetch wrapper pointed at Governance Layer

async function getCityEnergy(city, role) {
  // role could be "public", "researcher", or "utilityAdmin"
  const res = await api.get('/data/public-energy', {
    params: { city, role }
  });
  console.log(res);
}

getCityEnergy('Springfield', 'public');
```

_Explanation:_ We call the Governance Layer’s `/data/public-energy` endpoint with a `role` query. The Governance Layer will apply rules, then forward to the real Data Service if allowed.

### 3.2 Governance Layer: Enforcement & Forwarding

```js
// File: governance-layer/server.js
const express = require('express');
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const { loadPolicies, checkCompliance } = require('./policies');
const { logAudit } = require('./audit');
const app = express();

app.get('/data/public-energy', async (req, res) => {
  const policies = loadPolicies('public-energy');
  const allowed  = checkCompliance(policies, req.query);
  logAudit('public-energy', req.query, allowed);

  if (!allowed) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Access denied by governance rules' });
  }
  // forward to the real data service
  const data = await fetch(`http://data-service/energy?city=${req.query.city}`)
    .then(r => r.json());
  res.json(data);
});

app.listen(9000, () => console.log('Governance Layer running on 9000'));
```

_Explanation:_  
1. **loadPolicies** pulls the set of rules for “public-energy”  
2. **checkCompliance** runs each rule against the request  
3. **logAudit** records the request and decision  
4. If allowed, we forward to `data-service`; otherwise return 403

## 4. Under the Hood: Step-by-Step Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Client
  participant Gov as GovernanceLayer
  participant Pol as PolicyRegistry
  participant Data as DataService
  participant Audit as AuditDB

  Client->>Gov: GET /data/public-energy?city=X&role=Y
  Gov->>Pol: load policies('public-energy')
  Pol-->>Gov: [rule1, rule2]
  Gov->>Gov: check policies against {city,X; role,Y}
  Gov->>Audit: log {resource,params,allowed}
  alt allowed
    Gov->>Data: GET /energy?city=X
    Data-->>Gov: {...data...}
    Gov-->>Client: {...data...}
  else denied
    Gov-->>Client: 403 Access denied
  end
```

## 5. Inside the Governance Layer

### 5.1 Policy Registry

```js
// File: governance-layer/policies.js
const store = {
  'public-energy': [
    req => ['public','researcher','utilityAdmin'].includes(req.role),
    req => req.city !== 'RestrictedZone'
  ]
];

function loadPolicies(name) {
  return store[name] || [];
}

function checkCompliance(policies, req) {
  return policies.every(rule => rule(req));
}

module.exports = { loadPolicies, checkCompliance };
```

_Explanation:_  
- We keep a simple in-memory `store` of named rule lists.  
- Each rule is a function returning `true` or `false`.  
- `checkCompliance` returns true only if every rule passes.

### 5.2 Audit Logger

```js
// File: governance-layer/audit.js
const audits = [];

function logAudit(resource, context, allowed) {
  audits.push({
    id: audits.length + 1,
    resource, context, allowed,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
}

module.exports = { logAudit };
```

_Explanation:_  
- We record each request with parameters, whether it was allowed, and a timestamp.  
- In a real system, this goes to a durable AuditDB for compliance reporting.

## 6. Summary & Next Steps

You’ve learned how the **Governance Layer**:

- Acts as a single checkpoint for policies across all services.  
- Loads rules from a central registry, checks compliance, logs audits.  
- Forwards allowed requests to downstream services and rejects disallowed ones.

With this city-council approach, every component—data, AI agents, APIs—operates under a consistent, auditable framework.

Up next, we’ll explore the **[Management Layer](09_management_layer_.md)**, where administrators oversee runtime configurations, feature flags, and service orchestration.
