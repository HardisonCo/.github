# Chapter 10: Policy Versioning & Deployment Pipeline  

*(You just ratified a rule in [Governance Layer (HMS-GOV)](09_governance_layer__hms_gov__.md).  
Now we‚Äôll see **how that rule safely marches from ‚Äúapproved paper‚Äù to running code**‚Äîjust like a bill becoming law.)*

## 1‚ÄÇWhy Do We Need Yet Another Pipeline?  

### One-minute use-case ‚Äî ‚ÄúNew HazMat Label Rules‚Äù

The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) publishes a policy:  
*‚ÄúLithium-ion batteries must display the new **UN 3481** label.‚Äù*

1. Policy analyst Dana submits the YAML draft.  
2. Review board ratifies it (Chapter 9).  
3. **But** dozens of field scanners, mobile apps, and airline portals must update *exactly the same day*‚Äîor passengers will miss flights.

The **Policy Versioning & Deployment Pipeline (PVDP)** is our automated Federal Register:

Draft ‚Üí signed ‚Üí compiled ‚Üí tested ‚Üí staged ‚Üí **published nationwide** with an audit trail.

Without PVDP, every team would update manually at 2 a.m. and hope for the best.

## 2‚ÄÇKey Ideas in Plain English  

| Term                        | Beginner-friendly meaning                                          |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Policy Commit               | A snapshot of a policy, stored like a Git commit.                  |
| Metadata                    | Who wrote it, when, diff lines, test results.                      |
| Compile Step                | Turn human YAML ‚Üí machine JSON / Rego / SQL.                       |
| Validation Suite            | Tiny automated tests; e.g., ‚Äúthreshold between 0 and 1‚Äù.           |
| Staging Environment         | Safe sandbox where only testers can see the new rule.              |
| Promotion Gate              | Green light that moves artefact from staging ‚Üí production.         |
| Rollback                    | Auto-revert to last good version if smoke tests fail.              |

Analogy:  
Congress (HMS-GOV) passes a law ‚Üí Government Printing Office prints it ‚Üí Agencies test enforcement ‚Üí Federal Register ‚Äúpublishes‚Äù ‚Üí The rule is live at every checkpoint.

## 3‚ÄÇQuick Start ‚Äî Ship One Policy End-to-End  

We will push **fraud-threshold v2** (from Chapter 9) through the pipeline.

### 3.1 Commit the Policy  

```bash
# ONE command = one commit
hms policy commit fraud-threshold-v2.yaml \
  --message "Raise to 0.85" \
  --author "dana@prc.gov"
```

Output:

```txt
‚úî Saved as commit 9f31c2b @ 2024-06-05 14:03Z
```

**What just happened?**  
A ‚Äúcommit object‚Äù was stored in **PolicyRepo** (a Postgres table).  
It contains the file, author, timestamp, and a diff from v1.

---

### 3.2 Kick Off the Pipeline  

```bash
hms policy pipeline run 9f31c2b
```

Live log (trimmed):

```txt
‚è≥ compile........OK 0.4 s
‚è≥ unit-tests.....OK 5/5 passed
‚è≥ staging-deploy.OK
‚è≥ smoke-tests....OK latency < 200 ms
üéâ promote........DONE ‚Üí production v2
```

That‚Äôs it‚Äîfraud-threshold v2 is now active across HMS.

## 4‚ÄÇUnder the Hood ‚Äî Five Simple Stages  

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Author as Policy Author
  participant Repo as PolicyRepo
  participant CI as CI Runner
  participant STG as Staging Env
  participant PROD as Production

  Author->>Repo: commit(file+meta)
  Repo->>CI: trigger pipeline
  CI->>CI: compile + validate
  CI->>STG: deploy artefact
  STG-->>CI: smoke test result
  alt all green
    CI->>PROD: promote artefact
  else any red
    CI-->>Repo: mark commit "FAILED"
  end
```

Only **five participants** keep the flow easy to picture.

## 5‚ÄÇTiny Code Tour (All ‚â§ 20 Lines)  

### 5.1 Commit Object (simplified)  

```ts
// repo/commit.ts
export interface Commit {
  id: string;             // sha hash
  policyId: string;
  version: number;
  author: string;
  ts: number;
  diff: string;           // unified diff text
  tests?: TestResult[];
  status: 'PENDING' | 'FAILED' | 'PROMOTED';
}
```

*Every row looks like a Git commit‚Äîeasy to diff & audit.*

---

### 5.2 Compile Step (YAML ‚Üí JSON)  

```ts
// pipeline/compile.ts
import yaml from 'yaml';
export function compile(raw: Buffer){
  const doc = yaml.parse(raw.toString());
  return JSON.stringify(doc.changes); // machine-readable
}
```

*Under 10 lines; more complex rules could emit Rego.*

---

### 5.3 Validation Suite (one generic rule)  

```ts
// pipeline/validate.ts
export function test(changes){
  if ('fraudThreshold' in changes &&
      (changes.fraudThreshold < 0 || changes.fraudThreshold > 1))
    throw new Error('fraudThreshold must be 0-1');
}
```

*Add more mini-tests as your agency‚Äôs catalogue grows.*

---

### 5.4 Promotion Gate  

```ts
// pipeline/promote.ts
export async function promote(commitId){
  await db.tx(async sql=>{
    await sql`UPDATE commits SET status = 'PROMOTED' WHERE id = ${commitId}`;
    await sql`INSERT INTO active_policies(commit_id) VALUES (${commitId})`;
  });
}
```

*Single transaction guarantees atomic cut-over.*

## 6‚ÄÇBeginner-Friendly Local Demo (‚âà 30 s)  

```bash
# 1. start toy services
docker compose up repo ci staging production
# 2. commit + run
hms policy commit demo.yaml --message "demo" --author "you@agency.gov"
hms policy pipeline run HEAD
```

Open `http://localhost:5050/policies` and watch the status column flip from PENDING ‚Üí PROMOTED.

## 7‚ÄÇCommon Pitfalls & Easy Fixes  

| Pitfall                                       | Quick Fix |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Forgetting tests, pipeline lets bad value pass | Add **`validate.ts`** guardrails; pipeline fails fast. |
| Long staging smoke tests block prod release   | Parallelise tests or set a **max-duration** gate (e.g., 3 min). |
| ‚ÄúWorked on dev laptop but not in CI‚Äù          | Compile inside a **container** to freeze Node / Python versions. |
| Need to hotfix prod ASAP                      | `hms policy rollback <version>` instantly re-promotes previous commit. |

## 8‚ÄÇWhy Auditors & Developers Both Smile  

‚Ä¢ Every change carries a **diff + test log**‚Äîno mystery toggles.  
‚Ä¢ Rollbacks are **one command**, because old artefacts stay in PolicyRepo.  
‚Ä¢ Status badges show ‚Äústaging OK / production OK‚Äù‚Äîconfidence for releases.

## 9‚ÄÇRecap & What‚Äôs Next  

You learned how the **Policy Versioning & Deployment Pipeline**:  

1. Stores each update like a Git commit with full metadata.  
2. Compiles, tests, and stages the rule automatically.  
3. Promotes (or rolls back) with an auditable push-button flow.  

Once the rule is live we still need to verify it behaves in the wild and feed real-world metrics back to analysts.  
That‚Äôs the job of our next module: [Telemetry & Feedback Loop](11_telemetry___feedback_loop_.md).
