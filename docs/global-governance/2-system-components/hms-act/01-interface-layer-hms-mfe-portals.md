# Chapter 1: Interface Layer (HMS-MFE & Portals)


> ‚ÄúCitizens should spend minutes‚Äînot months‚Äîfinding government services.‚Äù  
> ‚Äî Every frustrated taxpayer, ever

The Interface Layer is the public face of HMS-ACT.  
Think of it as the government‚Äôs **lobby**: doors for citizens, kiosks for staff, and tablets for ministers‚Äî‚Äãall assembled from the same set of Lego-like UI bricks.

## 1. Why Do We Need an Interface Layer?

### A 60-Second Story  
Maria owns a small bakery in Austin. She wants a federal permit to ship her award-winning cookies to military bases overseas. Traditionally she would:

1. Discover a PDF buried three clicks deep on a .gov site.  
2. Print, fill, sign, scan, and email it.  
3. Wait weeks for status updates‚Äîwith zero visibility.

With HMS:

1. Maria visits **permit.gov** (a portal built with HMS-MFE).  
2. She fills out an online form that *also* powers an internal inspector dashboard.  
3. Real-time status and notifications keep her in the loop.

The Interface Layer solves two pains:

* **Consistent experience** ‚Äî Citizens, staff, and leadership see the same data in different skins.  
* **Faster delivery** ‚Äî Agencies compose portals from ready-made bricks instead of reinventing UI wheels.

## 2. Key Concepts in Plain English

| Term | Friendly Explanation |
|------|----------------------|
| **Portal** | A full website (public or internal) assembled from HMS-MFE bricks. |
| **Micro-Frontend (MFE)** | A self-contained UI piece, like ‚ÄúUpload Document,‚Äù that can live on any portal page. |
| **UI Brick** | Our nickname for an MFE‚Äîsmall, reusable, snap-together component. |
| **Event Bus** | A messenger hallway where bricks talk (‚ÄúForm Submitted!‚Äù). |
| **Localization Hook** | A placeholder where translators drop text for Spanish, French, etc. |

Analogy:  
Building a portal is like creating a wall of Lego plates‚Äîsnap blue bricks for forms, red bricks for charts, and yellow bricks for notifications.  
The Event Bus is the chat channel they all listen to.

## 3. Building Your First Portal (A Teeny Demo)

Below is a **React-ish** example that mounts two HMS-MFE bricks: a PermitForm and a StatusTimeline.

```javascript
// portal/index.js  (12 lines)
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import { PermitForm, StatusTimeline, EventBus } from '@hms-mfe/bricks';

function App() {
  return (
    <EventBus>
      <PermitForm agency="CFTC" />     {/* Citizen enters data */}
      <StatusTimeline />               {/* Shows live status */}
    </EventBus>
  );
}

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />);
```

What happens?

1. `PermitForm` broadcasts `form:submitted` on the Event Bus.  
2. `StatusTimeline` listens and refreshes progress.  
3. Both bricks automatically pull styles from the agency theme (e.g., usa-blue for CFTC).

## 4. Step-By-Step Under the Hood

How does a simple ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù click travel through the stack?

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as Citizen
    participant UI as PermitForm Brick
    participant Bus as Event Bus
    participant API as HMS-API*
    participant DB as Central Data Repo*

    User->>UI: click "Submit"
    UI->>Bus: emit form:submitted(payload)
    Bus->>API: POST /permits
    API->>DB: store application
    API-->>Bus: status:received
```

`*` We‚Äôll dive into these layers in later chapters.

## 5. Extending for Staff Kiosks

Imagine an inspector at the U.S. Army depot.  
She logs into **staff.army.gov**‚Äîa private portal using the *same* bricks:

```javascript
// kiosk/dashboard.js  (10 lines)
import { TaskQueue, DocumentViewer } from '@hms-mfe/bricks';
import { withRoleGuard } from '@hms-auth'; // from next chapter üëÄ

export default withRoleGuard('inspector', () => (
  <>
    <TaskQueue filter="pending" />
    <DocumentViewer />
  </>
));
```

`withRoleGuard` is explained in [Role & Identity Management (Accounts & Authorization)](02_role___identity_management__accounts___authorization__.md).

## 6. Customizing Look & Feel

Each agency ships a tiny JSON file:

```json
// themes/cftc.json
{
  "primaryColor": "#005ea2",
  "logo": "/img/cftc-seal.svg",
  "fontFamily": "Source Sans Pro"
}
```

At build time (or dynamically), the portal loader injects these values so every brick instantly ‚Äúre-skins‚Äù without code changes‚Äîjust like USAID‚Äôs ForeignAssistance.gov redesign.

## 7. A Peek at the Interface Layer Repo

The project tree (simplified):

```
hms-interface/
 ‚îú‚îÄ bricks/
 ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ PermitForm/
 ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ StatusTimeline/
 ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ TaskQueue/
 ‚îú‚îÄ themes/
 ‚îú‚îÄ event-bus/
 ‚îî‚îÄ README.md
```

### Mini Implementation: The Event Bus

```javascript
// event-bus/index.js  (18 lines)
import React, { createContext, useCallback, useContext, useRef } from 'react';

const BusContext = createContext();

export function EventBus({ children }) {
  const listeners = useRef({});

  const emit = useCallback((type, data) =>
    (listeners.current[type] || []).forEach(fn => fn(data)), []);

  const on = useCallback((type, fn) => {
    listeners.current[type] = (listeners.current[type] || []).concat(fn);
  }, []);

  return (
    <BusContext.Provider value={{ emit, on }}>
      {children}
    </BusContext.Provider>
  );
}

export const useBus = () => useContext(BusContext);
```

Explanation:

1. `emit` pushes messages.  
2. Bricks call `useBus().on('event', fn)` to listen.  
3. All stays in-browser‚Äîfast and light.

## 8. Where Does This Fit in HMS-ACT?

The Interface Layer glues into other layers you‚Äôll meet soon:

* Talks to the orchestration engine in [HMS-ACT Orchestration Engine](09_hms_act_orchestration_engine_.md).  
* Relies on the auth layer described next.  
* Uses components documented in [Micro-Frontend Component Library (HMS-MFE)](15_micro_frontend_component_library__hms_mfe__.md).

---

## 9. Recap

You learned:

1. The Interface Layer offers Lego-style bricks for building portals.  
2. Micro-frontends communicate through an Event Bus.  
3. The same bricks power citizen, staff, and leadership views with different skins.
