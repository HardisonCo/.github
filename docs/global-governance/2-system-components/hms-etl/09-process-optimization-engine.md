# Chapter 9: Process Optimization Engine

In [Chapter 8: Metrics & Outcome Monitoring](08_metrics___outcome_monitoring_.md), you learned how to track KPIs and display real-time dashboards. Now it’s time to use those metrics—along with logs and user feedback—to automatically redesign and improve your processes. Welcome to the **Process Optimization Engine**!

---

## 1. Why a Process Optimization Engine?

**Use Case:**  
A corrections bureau wants to optimize inmate scheduling and resource allocation in its facilities. Right now, scheduling is done by hand based on historical patterns and manager intuition. What if we could:

- Ingest platform logs (e.g., door-entry times, incident reports)
- Combine them with user complaints (e.g., “recreation time too short”)
- Factor in performance metrics (e.g., average cell checks per guard)  
- Simulate “what-if” scenarios (e.g., shift overlap changes)  
- Propose a revised schedule that reduces bottlenecks and complaint volume

The **Process Optimization Engine** acts like an internal data-science consultant: it models current workflows, runs simulations on alternative setups, and recommends the best new process.

## 2. Key Concepts

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   Collects raw inputs: platform logs, complaint records, performance metrics.

2. **Data Transformer**  
   Cleans and structures these inputs into a unified format.

3. **Process Modeler**  
   Builds a simplified representation of the current workflow (e.g., inmate movements, guard shifts).

4. **What-If Simulator**  
   Runs scenario simulations to estimate outcomes (e.g., fewer late-night incidents).

5. **Workflow Recommender**  
   Scores each scenario and outputs the top suggestions for process redesign.

## 3. How to Use the Process Optimization Engine

Below is a minimal example showing how to ingest data and get scheduling recommendations:

```python
# File: example_optimize.py
from hms_etl.optimization import ProcessOptimizer

opt = ProcessOptimizer()

# 1. Ingest data from files or APIs
opt.ingest_logs("data/platform_logs.csv")
opt.ingest_user_complaints("data/complaints.csv")
opt.ingest_metrics({"avg_cell_checks": 5, "avg_complaint_rate": 0.02})

# 2. Run the optimization for inmate scheduling
recommendations = opt.optimize_scheduling(scenario="inmate_scheduling")

print(recommendations)
# -> [
#      {"shift": "Morning", "guards": 20, "inmates": 150},
#      {"shift": "Evening", "guards": 18, "inmates": 140}
#    ]
```

Explanation:  
1. We create a `ProcessOptimizer`.  
2. We load logs, complaints, and key metrics.  
3. We call `optimize_scheduling()`, specifying our scenario.  
4. We receive a list of proposed shifts and resource allocations.

## 4. Under the Hood: Sequence Diagram

Here’s a simplified flow of what happens when you call `optimize_scheduling()`:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Admin
  participant ETL as ETL System
  participant Opt as ProcessOptimizer
  participant Sim as What-If Simulator
  participant Audit as Audit Log

  Admin->>ETL: request optimize_scheduling()
  ETL->>Opt: ingest_logs(), ingest_complaints(), ingest_metrics()
  Opt->>Opt: build internal model
  Opt->>Sim: simulate("inmate_scheduling")
  Sim-->>Opt: scenario outcomes
  Opt->>Audit: log(recommendations)
  Opt-->>ETL: return recommendations
  ETL-->>Admin: display results
```

1. **ingest_*** methods load and structure your data.  
2. The **ProcessOptimizer** builds a workflow model.  
3. The **Simulator** runs defined scenarios.  
4. Results get logged and returned as actionable recommendations.

## 5. Inside the Code

Let’s peek at a simplified `hms_etl/optimization.py` implementation.

### 5.1 Class and Data Ingestion

```python
# File: hms_etl/optimization.py

class ProcessOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logs = []
        self.complaints = []
        self.metrics = {}

    def ingest_logs(self, filepath):
        # Very basic CSV reader
        with open(filepath) as f:
            self.logs = [line.strip().split(',') for line in f]

    def ingest_user_complaints(self, filepath):
        # Read complaints similarly
        with open(filepath) as f:
            self.complaints = [line.strip() for line in f]

    def ingest_metrics(self, metrics_dict):
        self.metrics = metrics_dict
```

*Explanation:* We store each data source in simple in-memory lists or dictionaries.

### 5.2 Optimization Entry Point

```python
    def optimize_scheduling(self, scenario):
        model = self._build_model()
        return self._simulate(model, scenario)
```

*Explanation:*  
- `_build_model()` packages logs, complaints, and metrics into a unified structure.  
- `_simulate()` runs the “what-if” logic for the chosen scenario.

### 5.3 Building the Model and Simulating

```python
    def _build_model(self):
        # Combine data into a simple dict
        return {
            "logs": self.logs,
            "complaints": self.complaints,
            "metrics": self.metrics
        }

    def _simulate(self, model, scenario):
        # Fake simulation: in real life use optimization algorithms
        if scenario == "inmate_scheduling":
            # Return two dummy shift plans
            return [
                {"shift": "Morning", "guards": 20, "inmates": 150},
                {"shift": "Evening", "guards": 18, "inmates": 140}
            ]
        return []
```

*Explanation:*  
- Here you would plug in genuine simulation and optimization code (linear programming, discrete-event simulation, etc.).  
- We return the top candidate workflows as Python dictionaries.

## 6. Conclusion

In this chapter, you learned how to:

- Ingest platform logs, user complaints, and performance metrics.  
- Build a basic process model and run “what-if” simulations.  
- Generate actionable workflow recommendations (e.g., optimized inmate schedules).  

Next up, we’ll introduce an AI-powered front desk for your ETL platform in [Chapter 10: AI Representative Agent](10_ai_representative_agent_.md). Happy optimizing!
