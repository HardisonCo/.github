# HMS-CDF: Codified Democracy Foundation with Trade Analysis

HMS-CDF (Codified Democracy Foundation) is the core legislative and economic engine of the HMS ecosystem. It provides a structured framework for policy development, trade agreement analysis, and fiscal impact assessment.

## Overview

The HMS-CDF component takes legislative concepts and transforms them into actionable policies with comprehensive trade and economic analysis. It serves as the bridge between policy intentions and quantifiable economic outcomes.

## Key Features

- **Legislative Process Management**: Structured workflows for policy development
- **Deal Process with Trade Analysis**: Economic impact assessment for trade agreements
- **Fiscal Policy Visualization**: Data-driven visualizations of economic impacts
- **Trade Opportunity Analysis**: Integration with Moneyball Analytics for trade opportunity identification
- **Stakeholder Engagement Tools**: Collaboration features for policy stakeholders

## Architecture

HMS-CDF follows a layered architecture that integrates with other HMS components:

1. **Governance Layer**: Integration with HMS-GOV for policy administration
2. **Economic Analysis Core**: Trade and fiscal impact assessment engines
3. **Visualization Layer**: Interactive data visualization capabilities
4. **API Layer**: Programmatic access to policy and economic data
5. **Integration Layer**: Connections to HMS-NFO, HMS-ACT, and other components

## Integration with Trade Analytics

HMS-CDF now provides enhanced trade and economic analysis capabilities through integration with the HMS-NFO Moneyball Analytics Framework. This integration enables:

- **Economic Impact Assessment**: Quantitative analysis of policy impacts on GDP, employment, and trade balance
- **Sector-Specific Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of impacts by industry sector
- **Opportunity Identification**: Discovery of undervalued trade sectors and market access opportunities
- **Tariff & Non-Tariff Analysis**: Evaluation of policy effects on trade barriers
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs for economic data presentation

## Getting Started

To begin working with HMS-CDF:

```javascript
// Initialize the HMS-CDF client
const cdfClient = new HmsCdfClient({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  environment: 'production'
});

// Create a new legislative proposal with trade focus
const legislativeProposal = await cdfClient.legislation.create({
  title: 'Digital Trade Agreement Framework',
  description: 'Framework for cross-border digital services and data flows',
  tradeFocus: true,
  fiscalAnalysisRequired: true,
  sectors: ['digital_services', 'telecommunications', 'financial_services']
});

// Retrieve economic impact analysis
const economicImpact = await cdfClient.tradeAnalysis.getEconomicImpact(
  legislativeProposal.id, 
  { scenario: 'full_implementation' }
);

// Generate visualizations
const visualizations = await cdfClient.visualization.generate(
  economicImpact.id,
  { formats: ['html', 'png'], includeDataTables: true }
);

console.log(`Legislative proposal created with ID: ${legislativeProposal.id}`);
console.log(`Economic impact assessment completed with score: ${economicImpact.score}`);
console.log(`Generated ${visualizations.length} visualizations`);
```
