# Chapter 1: Governance Interface Layer (HMS-GOV)

> “Think of HMS-GOV as the front desk where every policy, form, and AI recommendation **must** get a human stamp before it goes live.”

## 1. Why Do We Need HMS-GOV?

Imagine you are an analyst at the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  
Last night an AI Agent auto-generated a new purchasing-card policy that could save \$2 M a year. Before that change reaches thousands of civil-servant desktops, someone (you!) must:

1. Open the proposal  
2. Check that it follows federal acquisition laws  
3. Adjust the spending limit from \$10 000 to \$9 500  
4. Approve & publish it—or send it back for revision

HMS-GOV gives you one page to do all that, **without** diving into code, databases, or ten different systems. In short, it is the **“mission-control dashboard” for policy-makers.**

## 2. Key Ideas in Plain English

| Concept | Friendly Analogy |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| Unified Dashboard | Like a city clerk’s counter where building permits, zoning maps, and inspection reports are all in one pile |
| Review Workflow | A traffic-light: green (approve), yellow (tweak), red (reject) |
| Override & Publish | The “signature” that makes a draft legally binding |
| Audit Log | A security camera that records **who** did **what** and **when** |

## 3. A 3-Minute Tour: Approving a Policy

Below is a **tiny demo** of what a developer would wire up so an OMB official can approve a policy proposal.

### 3.1 Fetch proposals waiting for review

```js
// hms-gov.service.js
export async function listPending() {
  const res = await fetch('/api/hms-gov/proposals?status=pending');
  return res.json();         // -> [{ id: 42, title: 'Purchase Card Update', ... }]
}
```

*We call a REST endpoint. The backend returns all drafts with status `pending`.*

### 3.2 Minimal Vue component to display the list

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h2>Pending Proposals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li v-for="p in proposals" :key="p.id">
        {{ p.title }}
        <button @click="open(p.id)">Review</button>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'
import { listPending } from '@/services/hms-gov.service.js'

const proposals = ref([])
onMounted(async () => (proposals.value = await listPending()))
function open(id) { /* open a modal or route to detail page */ }
</script>
```

*Less than 20 lines shows a living list. A user clicks “Review” to drill into details.*

### 3.3 Approve & publish

```js
export async function approve(id, tweaks = {}) {
  await fetch(`/api/hms-gov/proposals/${id}/approve`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ tweaks })
  })
}
```

*The service calls `/approve`; the backend records the decision and triggers downstream systems.*

## 4. What Happens Under the Hood?

Let’s walk through a happy path in five steps.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant AG as AI Agent
  participant CDF as Policy Engine
  participant GOV as HMS-GOV
  participant OFF as Human Official
  participant ACT as Workflow Orchestrator
  AG->>CDF: Submit draft policy
  CDF->>GOV: Store draft & mark pending
  OFF->>GOV: Opens dashboard, tweaks values
  OFF->>GOV: Clicks "Approve"
  GOV->>ACT: Publish task (green light)
```

1. **AI Agent** (we will build it in [Agent Framework](07_agent_framework__hms_agt___hms_agx__.md)) creates a draft policy.  
2. **Policy & Legislative Engine** ([HMS-CDF](02_policy___legislative_engine__hms_cdf__.md)) validates statutes and forwards it to HMS-GOV.  
3. **Human official** reviews via the dashboard.  
4. On approval, HMS-GOV records the signature in the **Audit Log**.  
5. **Workflow Orchestrator** ([HMS-ACT](05_workflow_orchestrator__hms_act__.md)) distributes the now-official policy to live systems.

## 5. Peeking Into the Codebase

Our repository has a placeholder page already:

```vue
<!-- File: pages/protocol-builder/index.vue -->
<template>
  <div class="protocol-builder">
    <h1>Protocol Builder</h1>
  </div>
</template>
```

We’ll extend this page later to embed the HMS-GOV review widget.

### 5.1 Server route (Express-style pseudo-code)

```js
// routes/hms-gov.js
router.post('/proposals/:id/approve', async (req, res) => {
  const { tweaks } = req.body
  await db.proposals.update(req.params.id, { status: 'approved', tweaks })
  await act.publishPolicy(req.params.id) // Notify HMS-ACT
  res.sendStatus(204)
})
```

1. Update record  
2. Call HMS-ACT SDK  
3. Return `204 No Content`

That’s it! Real code adds authentication, input validation, and error handling—details we will revisit in [Observability & Operations](17_observability___operations__hms_ops__.md).

## 6. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is HMS-GOV only for federal agencies?**  
A: No—the same pattern works for state, city, or even a university senate. Anywhere a human must sign off before automation fires.

**Q: How does it integrate with external systems like a budgeting ERP?**  
A: After approval, HMS-ACT uses the [External System Synchronizer](12_external_system_synchronizer_.md) to push changes.

## 7. What You Learned

• HMS-GOV is the **front desk** where humans approve or reject AI-generated changes.  
• It centralizes dashboards, workflows, and audit logs.  
• With a few lines of code you can list, review, and approve proposals.  
• Under the hood, it collaborates with HMS-CDF, HMS-ACT, and more.
