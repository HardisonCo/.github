## 1. Why Should Anyone Care?

Meet **Ravi**, an investigator at the **Office of the Inspector General (OIG)**.  
He receives a congressional request:

> ‚ÄúShow every change that led the AI system to deny rural broadband grants last quarter.‚Äù  

Without a **tamper-proof audit trail**, Ravi would:

* Chase scattered log files  
* Compare inconsistent time zones  
* Pray nobody overwrote yesterday‚Äôs CSV  

With the **Compliance & Audit Trail Module (CATM)**, he simply opens a filter:

```
Agency      = USDA
Grant Type  = Rural Broadband
Date Range  = 2023-Q2
Action      = deny_grant
```

A few seconds later he exports a digitally signed PDF bundle ready for GAO review.  
This chapter shows how CATM makes that magic possible‚Äîand how **you** can record, verify, and retrieve every important event with three tiny helper functions.

## 2. Key Concepts (Plain English)

| Term | What It Really Means | Friendly Analogy |
|------|----------------------|------------------|
| Audit Event | One immutable record of ‚Äúwho did what, when.‚Äù | A receipt from the cash register. |
| Digital Signature | Cryptographic stamp proving the event was not altered. | Wax seal on a legal letter. |
| Immutable Ledger | Append-only file/db where events live forever. | A bound paper ledger‚Äîpages can‚Äôt be ripped out. |
| Filter View | Simple query language to slice events by agency, user, or regulation. | Flipbook tabs in a binder. |
| Evidence Package | Zip/PDF containing events + signatures + hashes. | A numbered evidence bag for court. |

**Mnemonic:** *‚ÄúRavi Wants Signed, Searchable Receipts.‚Äù*

## 3. 3-Step Beginner Workflow

We will:

1. Record an event (AI recommends a decision).  
2. Record a second event (human overrides it).  
3. Pull a filtered report for OIG.

### 3.1 Record an Event (10 lines)

```ts
// catm/record.ts
import { sign, append } from "./ledger";

export function record(actor, action, details){
  const event = {
    ts      : Date.now(),
    actor   : actor,          // e.g., "ai_agent_7"
    action  : action,         // e.g., "recommend_deny"
    details : details         // any object ‚â§ 2KB
  };
  event.sig = sign(event);    // üîè adds digital signature
  append(event);              // ‚ûï writes to ledger
}
```

Explanation  
1. Build a small JSON object.  
2. `sign()` hashes and encrypts it.  
3. `append()` stores it‚Äînever to be edited.

---

### 3.2 Record a Human Override (8 lines)

```ts
// somewhere in HITL handler
record("lena.bor", "override_approve", {
  originalEvent : "eventId-1234",
  comment       : "Hydro needs steady power."
});
```

Lena‚Äôs name, timestamp, and comment are forever linked to the original AI suggestion.

---

### 3.3 Fetch a Report (18 lines)

```ts
// catm/query.ts
import { load } from "./ledger";

export function search(filters){
  const data = load();                       // returns all events
  return data.filter(e =>
    (!filters.agency  || e.details.agency  === filters.agency ) &&
    (!filters.action  || e.action          === filters.action ) &&
    (!filters.after   || e.ts              >= filters.after  ) &&
    (!filters.before  || e.ts              <= filters.before)
  );
}

// ravi_report.js
const events = search({
  agency : "USDA",
  action : "deny_grant",
  after  : Date.parse("2023-04-01"),
  before : Date.parse("2023-06-30")
});
console.log(events.length, "events found");
```

**Output (console):**  
`42 events found` ‚Äî ready for export.

## 4. What Happens Under the Hood?

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SRC as Any Service / UI
    participant CAT as CATM API
    participant LED as Immutable Ledger
    participant OIG as Auditor

    SRC->>CAT: record(event)
    CAT->>LED: append(entry+signature)
    OIG-->>CAT: search(filters)
    CAT-->>OIG: JSON / PDF bundle
```

1. Every service records **only** through CATM‚Äîone entry point.  
2. Ledger is append-only; even admins can‚Äôt delete rows.  
3. Auditors query via the same CATM‚Äîno direct DB access needed.

---

## 5. Inside the Box (Step-By-Step, No Big Code)

1. **API Layer** receives `record()` / `search()` calls.  
2. **Signature Service**:  
   ‚Ä¢ Serializes the event ‚Üí SHA-256 hash ‚Üí signs with platform private key.  
3. **Ledger Store** (could be DynamoDB, Postgres `INSERT ONLY`, or a simple file) appends the signed event.  
4. **Index Service** writes lightweight fields (timestamp, agency, action) into a searchable index (SQLite or Elasticsearch).  
5. **Export Service** bundles raw events + verification script into a zip/PDF.

---

## 6. Peeking at Implementation Files

```
hms-catm/
  src/
    record.ts       // tiny wrapper shown above
    query.ts        // filter helper
    ledger/
      append.ts     // low-level disk/db write
      load.ts
      verify.ts     // signature checker
    sign/
      sign.ts
      verifySig.ts
```

Beginners can open any file and understand it in under a minute.

---

### 6.1 Tiny Ledger Append (15 lines)

```ts
// ledger/append.ts
import fs from "fs";
const PATH = "ledger.jsonl";   // 1-event-per-line

export function append(event){
  fs.appendFileSync(PATH, JSON.stringify(event) + "\n");
}
```

Simple text file demo‚Äîswap for a real database later.

---

### 6.2 Verify Signature (14 lines)

```ts
// sign/verifySig.ts
import crypto from "crypto";
import { PUBLIC_KEY } from "./keys";

export function verify(event){
  const { sig, ...data } = event;
  const verifier = crypto.createVerify("RSA-SHA256");
  verifier.update(JSON.stringify(data));
  return verifier.verify(PUBLIC_KEY, sig, "base64");
}
```

Ravi can run this to confirm no one tampered with a record.

## 7. Hands-On Exercise (5 min)

1. Clone `hms-catm`, run `npm start demo`.  
2. Execute:

```bash
node demo/record_ai.js
node demo/record_override.js
node demo/export_report.js
```

3. Open `exports/report.zip`‚Äîyou‚Äôll find a CSV of events and a `verify.js` script.  
4. `node verify.js` ‚áí prints **‚ÄúAll 2 signatures valid ‚úÖ‚Äù**.  
You just produced an OIG-ready evidence package!

## 8. Common Pitfalls & Quick Fixes

| Pitfall | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Clock Skew | Events out of order | Force UTC everywhere (`ts` in ms) |
| Oversized `details` | Ledger bloat | Enforce ‚â§ 2 KB JSON schema |
| Missing signature | `verify()` fails | Add unit test: every append must include `sig` |

---

## 9. How CATM Links to Earlier Chapters

* **HITL Oversight** (Chapter 7) calls `record()` for every human decision.  
* **Values Framework** (Chapter 6) logs any value violation attempts.  
* **RBAC** (Chapter 3) ensures only privileged roles can run `search()` or export evidence.

## 10. What‚Äôs Next?

You now own a **digital body-cam** for every config tweak, AI suggestion, and human override.  
Auditors, IGs, or the GAO ask‚ÄîCATM answers with cryptographic confidence.
