# Internet Data Collection System

The Internet Data Collection System is the foundation of HMS-NFO, responsible for gathering, processing, and structuring data from diverse online sources to feed the knowledge repository.

## System Architecture

The data collection architecture implements a multi-stage process:

1. **Target Selection**: Intelligent identification of authoritative sources for government, economic, and trade data
2. **Scheduled Crawling**: Automated periodic collection from identified sources
3. **Content Processing**: NLP-based extraction of relevant information
4. **Knowledge Structuring**: Organization of extracted data into standardized formats
5. **Validation**: Multi-stage verification of data accuracy
6. **Integration**: Merging new data with existing knowledge

## Components

### Source Manager

```python
class SourceManager:
    """
    Manages the collection of data sources and their crawling schedules.
    Prioritizes sources based on credibility scores and content relevance.
    """
    def __init__(self, config_path="configs/sources.json"):
        self.sources = self._load_sources(config_path)
        self.crawling_history = {}
        
    def prioritize_sources(self, topic=None):
        """Prioritize sources based on credibility and relevance to a topic"""
        
    def schedule_crawling(self, frequency="daily"):
        """Generate crawling schedule based on source priority and update frequency"""
```

### Web Crawler

```python
class NFOWebCrawler:
    """
    Performs efficient, respectful web crawling of authorized sources.
    Implements proper rate limiting and obeys robots.txt.
    Focuses on targeted content extraction rather than bulk downloading.
    """
    def __init__(self, source_manager, proxy_config=None):
        self.source_manager = source_manager
        self.user_agents = self._load_user_agents()
        self.proxy_manager = ProxyManager(proxy_config) if proxy_config else None
        
    async def crawl_source(self, source):
        """Crawl a specific source with proper rate limiting"""
        
    def extract_content(self, html, source_type):
        """Extract relevant content based on source type and structure"""
```

### Content Processor

```python
class ContentProcessor:
    """
    Processes raw content from crawled sources into structured information.
    Uses LLM-based extraction for understanding complex data.
    """
    def __init__(self, llm_config):
        self.llm_client = self._initialize_llm(llm_config)
        self.extraction_templates = self._load_templates()
        
    def process_text(self, text, source_type):
        """Process raw text into structured data based on source type"""
        
    def extract_economic_indicators(self, text):
        """Extract economic indicators from statistical publications"""
        
    def extract_trade_data(self, text):
        """Extract international trade statistics and relationships"""
```

## Integration Points

The Internet Data Collection System integrates with:

- **Knowledge Integration Engine**: Feeds processed data for integration into the knowledge base
- **Learning System**: Receives feedback on data quality to improve source selection
- **Data Access API**: Provides metadata about data sources and freshness

## Operational Parameters

- **Crawling Frequency**: Tiered schedule (hourly, daily, weekly) based on source importance
- **Bandwidth Management**: Intelligent throttling to respect source servers
- **Authentication**: Secure handling of API keys for authorized data sources
- **Redundancy**: Multiple collection paths for critical data sources
- **Error Handling**: Graceful recovery from network issues or source changes

## Example Configuration

```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "name": "World Trade Organization",
      "url": "https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/statis_e/",
      "type": "trade_statistics",
      "credibility": 0.95,
      "update_frequency": "monthly",
      "extractor": "table_parser"
    },
    {
      "name": "Bureau of Economic Analysis",
      "url": "https://www.bea.gov/data/",
      "type": "economic_indicators",
      "credibility": 0.92,
      "update_frequency": "quarterly",
      "extractor": "json_api"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Performance Metrics

The Internet Data Collection System tracks:

- **Coverage**: Percentage of priority sources successfully crawled
- **Freshness**: Average age of data in the system
- **Extraction Quality**: Accuracy of structured data extraction
- **Resource Usage**: Bandwidth and processing efficiency
- **Integration Rate**: Speed of new data integration into knowledge base

Through this sophisticated data collection system, HMS-NFO maintains a comprehensive, up-to-date repository of information that powers the entire HMS ecosystem's understanding of government systems, trade relationships, and economic opportunities.
