# Knowledge Integration Engine

The Knowledge Integration Engine is the core processing component of HMS-NFO, responsible for transforming raw data into structured, queryable knowledge that can be utilized by other HMS components.

## System Architecture

The knowledge integration process follows these stages:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Receipt of processed data from the Internet Data Collection System
2. **Entity Recognition**: Identification of key entities within the data
3. **Relationship Mapping**: Establishing connections between entities
4. **Fact Validation**: Confirming accuracy through cross-referencing
5. **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Updating the central knowledge repository
6. **Querying Optimization**: Indexing for efficient retrieval

## Components

### Entity Manager

```python
class EntityManager:
    """
    Manages the catalog of entities within the knowledge base.
    Handles entity creation, deduplication, and relationship management.
    """
    def __init__(self, db_path="knowledge/entities.json"):
        self.entities = self._load_entities(db_path)
        self.entity_types = self._load_entity_types()
        
    def identify_entity(self, raw_entity, context):
        """Identify if an entity already exists or create a new one"""
        
    def establish_relationship(self, entity_a, entity_b, relationship_type):
        """Create a typed relationship between two entities"""
        
    def get_entity_network(self, entity_id, depth=2):
        """Retrieve an entity and its related entities to specified depth"""
```

### Knowledge Integrator

```python
class KnowledgeIntegrator:
    """
    Core component for integrating new information into the knowledge base.
    Uses LLM assistance to structure information and resolve conflicts.
    """
    def __init__(self, entity_manager, llm_config):
        self.entity_manager = entity_manager
        self.llm_client = self._initialize_llm(llm_config)
        self.confidence_threshold = 0.75
        
    def integrate_processed_content(self, content, source_metadata):
        """Integrate processed content into the knowledge base"""
        
    def resolve_conflicts(self, existing_data, new_data):
        """Resolve conflicts between existing knowledge and new information"""
        
    def calculate_confidence(self, data_point, corroborating_sources):
        """Calculate confidence score for a piece of information"""
```

### Trade Knowledge Specialist

```python
class TradeKnowledgeSpecialist:
    """
    Specialized component for processing trade-related information.
    Implements Moneyball principles for identifying undervalued opportunities.
    """
    def __init__(self, knowledge_integrator):
        self.knowledge_integrator = knowledge_integrator
        self.trade_models = self._load_trade_models()
        
    def process_trade_statistics(self, trade_data):
        """Process international trade statistics"""
        
    def identify_undervalued_sectors(self, country_a, country_b):
        """Apply Moneyball analytics to identify undervalued trade sectors"""
        
    def model_import_certificate_impact(self, trade_flow):
        """Model impact of import certificates on trade relationships"""
```

### Knowledge Graph

```python
class KnowledgeGraph:
    """
    Represents the central knowledge repository.
    Provides graph operations for traversing relationships and contextual retrieval.
    """
    def __init__(self, storage_path="knowledge/graph.db"):
        self.graph_db = self._initialize_graph_db(storage_path)
        self.query_templates = self._load_query_templates()
        
    def execute_query(self, query_template, parameters):
        """Execute a parametrized query against the knowledge graph"""
        
    def get_context(self, entity_ids, relationship_types=None):
        """Get contextual information around specified entities"""
        
    def find_paths(self, start_entity, end_entity, max_depth=3):
        """Find all connection paths between two entities"""
```

## Integration Points

The Knowledge Integration Engine connects with:

- **Internet Data Collection System**: Receives processed web data
- **Learning System**: Shares confidence scores and validation results
- **Moneyball Analytics Framework**: Provides specialized trade knowledge
- **Data Access API**: Exposes structured knowledge for querying
- **HMS-AGX**: Enhanced knowledge graph exchange for deeper analysis

## Knowledge Schema

The core knowledge schema includes:

- **Entities**: Countries, organizations, sectors, economic indicators, legislative frameworks
- **Relationships**: Trade flows, diplomatic relations, sector dependencies, financial mechanisms
- **Attributes**: Statistical data, growth rates, risk factors, governance structures
- **Temporal Data**: Historical trends, forecasts, scheduled policy changes
- **Source Metadata**: Origin of information, credibility rating, freshness

## Example Entity Structure

```json
{
  "entity_id": "country:usa",
  "type": "country",
  "names": {
    "official": "United States of America",
    "short": "USA",
    "aliases": ["United States", "US", "America"]
  },
  "attributes": {
    "gdp": {
      "value": 25460000000000.0,
      "unit": "USD",
      "year": 2023,
      "source": "world_bank:2023",
      "confidence": 0.98
    },
    "export_percent_gdp": {
      "value": 10.2,
      "unit": "percent",
      "year": 2023,

    "sources": ["world_bank", "imf", "wto"],
    "confidence": 0.95
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

The Knowledge Integration Engine is optimized for:

- **Incremental Updates**: Efficiently integrating new data without rebuilding the entire knowledge base
- **Conflict Resolution**: Intelligently handling contradictory information from different sources
- **Confidence Scoring**: Maintaining confidence levels for all knowledge assertions
- **Query Performance**: Fast retrieval of complex interconnected data
- **Scalability**: Handling growing volume of entities and relationships
- **Versioning**: Maintaining historical states of knowledge for temporal analysis

Through sophisticated knowledge integration, HMS-NFO provides an authoritative, queryable repository of government and trade information that powers intelligent decision-making across the HMS ecosystem.
