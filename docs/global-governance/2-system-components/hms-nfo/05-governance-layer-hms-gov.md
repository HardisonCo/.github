## 1. Why Do We Need a ‚ÄúCity Hall‚Äù for Software?

Meet Dana, the **Program Manager** at the **Office of Policy Development & Research (PD&R)**.  
Yesterday she noticed a security gap:

1. Citizens can file housing-grant forms without multi-factor authentication (MFA).  
2. Adding MFA will affect three agencies and two AI agents.  
3. Every change must be reviewed, approved, and logged for auditors.

If Dana emails engineers, versions get lost and auditors frown.  
Instead she opens **HMS-GOV**‚Äîa single, web-based ‚ÄúCity Hall‚Äù where **policies are proposed, debated, approved, and enforced** across the whole HMS platform.

## 3. Key Concepts (Plain English)

| Term | What It Means | Analogy |
|------|---------------|---------|
| Policy Draft | A proposed rule (e.g., ‚ÄúRequire MFA for housing-grant login‚Äù). | A new city ordinance on the council‚Äôs agenda. |
| Approval Queue | List of drafts awaiting signatures from authorized roles. | Stack of bills on the governor‚Äôs desk. |
| Audit Log | Tamper-proof history of who did what, when. | Court stenographer transcript. |
| AI Oversight Panel | Page showing AI suggestions & risk scores. | Advisory board briefing the council. |
| Policy Event | Machine-readable message like `policy.mfa.enabled`. | Press release sent to all departments. |

## 4. The MFA Use-Case in 3 Tiny Steps

### 4.1 Draft the Policy

```ts
// POST /policies
{
  "id": "mfa_2023_10",
  "title": "Enable MFA for Housing-Grant Filings",
  "description": "All citizen logins must pass MFA.",
  "status": "draft"
}
```

*What happens?*  
The draft appears on Dana‚Äôs dashboard with status ‚ÄúAwaiting Approval‚Äù.

---

### 4.2 Approve the Policy

```ts
// PATCH /policies/mfa_2023_10
{ "action": "approve", "approverId": "sec_officer_1" }
```

*Result:* Status flips to ‚Äúactive‚Äù; an **audit log** entry is created.

---

### 4.3 Event Gets Broadcast

```json
{
  "type": "policy.mfa.enabled",
  "payload": { "effectiveDate": "2023-10-12" }
}
```

HMS-MFE and AI agents subscribe and instantly enforce MFA. No code redeploy!

---

## 5. How It Works (No Heavy Code)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant PM as Program Mgr (Dana)
    participant GOV as HMS-GOV
    participant AUD as Audit Log
    participant SVC as Downstream Service

    PM->>GOV: Submit policy draft
    GOV->>AUD: write "draft created"
    PM->>GOV: Click "Approve"
    GOV->>AUD: write "approved by sec_officer_1"
    GOV-->>SVC: emit policy.mfa.enabled
    SVC-->>PM: MFA now required
```

---

## 6. Under the Hood (Step-by-Step)

1. **REST Layer**: Accepts `/policies` CRUD requests.  
2. **RBAC Check**: Verifies the caller has `role=program_manager` (see [Chapter 3](03_role_based_access_control__rbac__.md)).  
3. **Policy Store**: Writes the draft to a versioned database table.  
4. **Approval Workflow**: Moves item to ‚Äúqueue‚Äù and pings required approvers.  
5. **Event Bus**: On final approval, publishes a `policy.*` event to Kafka/SNS.  
6. **Audit Trail**: Every transition logs to an immutable `audit_logs` table (covered deeper in [Compliance & Audit Trail Module](08_compliance___audit_trail_module_.md)).

---

## 7. Minimal Code Peek (‚â§ 20 Lines Each)

### 7.1 Policy Schema

```ts
// models/Policy.ts
export type Status = "draft" | "queued" | "active" | "rejected";

export interface Policy {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  status: Status;
  createdBy: string;
  approvals: string[];   // userIds
  timestamps: Record<Status, number>;
}
```

*Purpose:* A single TypeScript interface shared by frontend & backend.

---

### 7.2 Guarded Route

```ts
// routes/createPolicy.ts
import { can } from "../access/can";      // from RBAC chapter
import { save } from "../db/policies";

app.post("/policies", (req, res) => {
  if (!can(req.user.role, "create:policy")) return res.status(403).end();
  const draft = { ...req.body, status: "draft", createdBy: req.user.id };
  save(draft);
  res.json(draft);
});
```

*Highlights:* One line of RBAC keeps unauthorized users out.

---

### 7.3 Event Publisher

```ts
// workflows/onApproved.ts
import bus from "../infra/eventBus";

export function onApproved(policy) {
  if (policy.status !== "active") return;
  bus.publish(`policy.${policy.id}.enabled`, {
    effectiveDate: Date.now(),
  });
}
```

*Takeaway:* Publishing an event is only two lines‚Äîsimple, yet powerful.

---

## 8. File Structure Glimpse

```
hms-gov/
  src/
    models/          // Policy.ts, AuditEntry.ts
    routes/          // createPolicy.ts, approvePolicy.ts
    workflows/       // onApproved.ts
    pages/           // Dashboard.vue, AuditLog.vue
    infra/
      eventBus.ts    // wraps Kafka or SNS
      db.ts          // tiny ORM wrapper
```

Each folder maps to a clear concern‚Äîeasy for beginners to navigate.

---

## 9. Hands-On Exercise (5 min)

1. Run `npm start` inside `hms-gov`.  
2. `POST /login` with `"role":"program_manager"`.  
3. `POST /policies` (body as in 4.1).  
4. Check `/dashboard`‚Äîyour draft appears.  
5. `PATCH /policies/<id>` to approve it.  
6. Watch the terminal: an event like `policy.mfa.enabled` prints.  
7. Open any HMS-MFE page‚Äîlogin now asks for MFA. üéâ

## 10. Common Pitfalls & Quick Fixes

| Problem | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Missing approver signature | Policy stuck in ‚Äúqueued‚Äù | Verify `requiredApprovers` list in settings. |
| Silent event failures | Downstream never updates | Add retry & dead-letter queue in `eventBus.ts`. |
| Audit gaps | Auditors flag missing records | Never bypass `audit.write()`‚Äîwrap it in middleware. |

---

## 11. What You Learned

‚Ä¢ HMS-GOV centralizes **policy drafting, approval, and auditing**.  
‚Ä¢ A tiny **event** turns policy decisions into platform-wide behavior.  
‚Ä¢ The layer leans on earlier abstractions: RBAC guards actions, and UI components come from the Library.
