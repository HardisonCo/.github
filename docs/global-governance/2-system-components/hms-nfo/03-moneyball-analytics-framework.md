# Moneyball Analytics Framework

The Moneyball Analytics Framework is a specialized component of HMS-NFO that applies statistical principles to identify undervalued opportunities in international trade and government programs, similar to how the Oakland Athletics used data analytics to identify undervalued baseball players.

## Overview

The Moneyball approach to trade and governance:

1. **Value Discovery**: Identifying opportunities that are statistically undervalued
2. **Market Inefficiencies**: Exploiting gaps between perceived and actual value
3. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Replacing intuition with statistical analysis
4. **Outcome Optimization**: Maximizing results with limited resources
5. **Continuous Refinement**: Evolving models based on outcome data

## Core Components

### Undervalued Sector Analyzer

```python
class UndervaluedSectorAnalyzer:
    """
    Analyzes international trade sectors to identify undervalued opportunities.
    Uses historical performance, growth trends, and complementary strengths.
    """
    def __init__(self, knowledge_graph):
        self.knowledge_graph = knowledge_graph
        self.historical_growth = self._load_historical_growth()
        self.traditional_focus = self._load_traditional_focus()
        
    def analyze_country_pair(self, country_a, country_b):
        """Analyze trade opportunities between two countries"""
        
    def calculate_opportunity_score(self, sector, country_a, country_b):
        """Calculate Moneyball opportunity score for a sector between countries"""
        
    def identify_top_opportunities(self, country, limit=10):
        """Identify top undervalued opportunities for a country"""
```

### Trade WAR Calculator

```python
class TradeWARCalculator:
    """
    Calculates Trade WAR (Wins Above Replacement) metrics for trade deals.
    Evaluates the performance of a trade deal versus a baseline "replacement" deal.
    """
    def __init__(self, trade_baseline="baseline/average_deal.json"):
        self.trade_baseline = self._load_baseline(trade_baseline)
        self.component_weights = self._initialize_weights()
        
    def calculate_war_score(self, deal_data):
        """Calculate overall WAR score for a trade deal"""
        
    def calculate_war_components(self, deal_data):
        """Calculate individual component metrics for a trade deal"""
        
    def calculate_country_specific_war(self, deal_data, country):
        """Calculate country-specific WAR score"""
```

### Import Certificate Modeler

```python
class ImportCertificateModeler:
    """
    Models the impact of Warren Buffett-style import certificates on trade flows.
    Analyzes balance effects, price impacts, and economic outcomes.
    """
    def __init__(self, trade_flow_data):
        self.trade_flow_data = trade_flow_data
        self.certificate_parameters = self._load_certificate_parameters()
        
    def model_certificate_issuance(self, country, volume, duration=180):
        """Model impact of issuing import certificates"""
        
    def calculate_balance_effect(self, from_country, to_country, certificate_volume):
        """Calculate effect on trade balance"""
        
    def optimize_certificate_expiry(self, trading_pattern):
        """Determine optimal certificate expiry period for a trading pattern"""
```

### Development Financing Optimizer

```python
class DevelopmentFinancingOptimizer:
    """
    Optimizes allocation of trade-generated development funds.
    Identifies high-impact development projects and allocations.
    """
    def __init__(self, knowledge_graph):
        self.knowledge_graph = knowledge_graph
        self.sector_impact_models = self._load_sector_impact_models()
        
    def optimize_allocation(self, available_funds, country):
        """Optimize allocation of development funds for maximum impact"""
        
    def identify_high_leverage_projects(self, country, sector, budget):
        """Identify development projects with highest return on investment"""
        
    def model_nth_degree_chain_benefits(self, country_chain, sector):
        """Model benefits of multi-country development chains"""
```

### Win-Win Balancer

```python
class WinWinBalancer:
    """
    Ensures balanced benefits between government and civilian stakeholders.
    Optimizes trade parameters for equitable outcomes.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.benefit_models = self._load_benefit_models()
        self.rebalancing_strategies = self._load_rebalancing_strategies()
        
    def analyze_benefit_distribution(self, deal_data):
        """Analyze how benefits are distributed in a trade deal"""
        
    def calculate_win_win_score(self, deal_data):
        """Calculate 0-1 score for benefit balance"""
        
    def recommend_rebalancing(self, deal_data):
        """Recommend adjustments to improve benefit balance"""
```

## Analytical Models

The framework implements several specialized analytical models:

### 1. Opportunity Value Index

Calculates the undervalued opportunity score using:

```
Opportunity Score = (Growth Rate × 10) × (1 + Complementarity) × 
                    Undervalued Rating × (2 - Traditional Focus)
```

Where:
- Growth Rate: Historical sector growth (0.0-0.1)
- Complementarity: Strength difference between countries (0.0-1.0)
- Undervalued Rating: How undervalued the sector is (1.0-2.0)
- Traditional Focus: How much traditional attention the sector receives (0.5-1.0)

### 2. Trade WAR Components

Calculates components that contribute to the Trade WAR score:

- Volume Potential: GDP-weighted trade capacity
- Complementarity: How well sectors complement each other
- Risk-Adjusted Return: Balance of opportunity vs. risk
- Diplomatic Factor: Relationship quality
- Innovation Potential: Combined growth in advanced sectors

### 3. Tariff Recommendation Model

Dynamically calculates optimal tariff rates based on:

```
Tariff = Base Rate × Balance Adjustment × Compliance Factor × Win-Win Correction
```

Where tariffs are adjusted to optimize:
- Trade balance
- Compliance with trade agreements
- Equitable benefit distribution
- Sector development goals

### 4. Nth Degree Chain Value

Models value creation in multi-country trade chains:

```
Chain Value = ∑(Direct Value) + Network Effect + Circularity Bonus - Transaction Costs
```

Where:
- Direct Value: Sum of all bilateral trade flows
- Network Effect: Added value from specialization across chain
- Circularity Bonus: Added value when first and last countries connect
- Transaction Costs: Overhead of managing multi-country chains

## Integration Points

The Moneyball Analytics Framework integrates with:

- **Knowledge Integration Engine**: Obtains economic and trade data
- **Data Access API**: Exposes analytics results to other HMS components
- **HMS-MBL**: Provides specialized analytics to the Moneyball trade system
- **HMS-ACH**: Informs financial mechanisms with opportunity analytics
- **HMS-ACT**: Provides actionable intelligence for policy decisions
