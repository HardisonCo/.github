   - Ensure all core MAC traits and interfaces are implemented
   - Focus on modularity and extensibility

2. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error types and propagation
   - Clear error messages and recovery paths

3. **Async Support**
   - Fully async-aware implementation
   - Proper handling of concurrency

4. **Testing**
   - Comprehensive unit tests
   - Integration tests for cross-module interactions

5. **Documentation**
   - Full API documentation
   - Usage examples and guides

## Progress Tracking

Weekly progress meetings will be held to:
- Review completed milestones
- Address any blockers or challenges
- Adjust timeline if necessary
- Prioritize upcoming tasks

## Resource Allocation

| Component | Lead Engineer | Supporting Team | Est. Effort (person-days) |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Core MAC Modules | Team Lead | 2 Engineers | 15 |
| Trade Balance Modules | Engineer A | 1 Engineer | 10 |
| Testing Framework | Engineer B | QA Team | 8 |
| Documentation | Technical Writer | Engineering Team | 5 |
| Performance Optimization | Engineer C | 1 Engineer | 7 |

## Risk Management

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| API incompatibility | Medium | High | Early interface validation, clear API contracts |
| Performance issues | Medium | Medium | Regular benchmarking, optimization passes |
| Integration challenges | High | Medium | Phased approach, early integration testing |
| Feature parity gaps | Medium | High | Comprehensive analysis, validation against Python code |

## Completion Criteria

The MAC Rust implementation will be considered complete when:

1. All modules are implemented with feature parity to Python
2. Test coverage reaches >80% for all modules
3. Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date
4. Performance meets or exceeds Python implementation
5. All integration tests pass successfully

## Future Enhancements (Post-Implementation)
