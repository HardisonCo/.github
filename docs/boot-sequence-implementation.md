# Boot Sequence Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of the Codex CLI boot sequence in both TypeScript and Rust.

## Overview

The boot sequence is a system for initializing components of the Codex CLI in a dependency-aware manner, with visual feedback on the initialization process. It supports:

1. Parallel initialization of independent components
2. Dependency-based ordering of component initialization
3. Visual feedback on the initialization process
4. Different view modes for different levels of detail
5. Accessibility options for users with different needs
6. Integration with existing CLI code

## TypeScript Implementation

The TypeScript implementation consists of the following key components:

- `dependency-manager.ts`: Handles dependency resolution and component initialization tracking
- `boot-sequence-renderer.ts`: Visual rendering of the boot sequence using React/Ink
- `boot-sequence.ts`: Integration with the CLI and management of the boot sequence process

### Dependency Manager

The dependency manager implements a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for tracking component dependencies. It provides:

- Topological sorting for determining initialization order
- Cycle detection to prevent circular dependencies
- Events for tracking component initialization status
- Methods for querying components ready for initialization

### Boot Sequence Renderer

The renderer provides a visual representation of the boot sequence using React/Ink. It includes:

- Multiple view modes (minimal, detailed, graph)
- Progress indication with percentage complete
- Component status indication with colors and icons
- Interactive keyboard controls for view switching and skipping
- Dependency visualization

### Boot Sequence Integration

The boot sequence integrates with the CLI through:

- Command line arguments for enabling/disabling the boot sequence
- Configuration options for appearance and behavior
- Integration with the existing initialization processes

## Rust Implementation

The Rust implementation parallels the TypeScript implementation but uses Rust-specific patterns and libraries:

- `dependency_manager.rs`: Implements the dependency graph and component tracking
- `boot_sequence_renderer.rs`: Visual rendering using Crossterm and Ratatui
- `boot_sequence.rs`: Manages the boot sequence process with Tokio async
- `integration.rs`: Provides integration with the CLI

### Dependency Manager

The Rust dependency manager provides similar functionality to its TypeScript counterpart:

- Graph-based dependency tracking using `petgraph` for graph algorithms
- Async-aware component initialization with Tokio
- Event channels for component status updates
- Thread-safe tracking of initialization state with `RwLock`

### Boot Sequence Renderer

The Rust renderer uses Ratatui for terminal UI rendering:

- Multiple view modes with different levels of detail
- Progress bars and component status indicators
- Event-based terminal UI with keyboard input handling
- Dependency visualization in graph mode

### Boot Sequence and Integration

The Rust boot sequence and integration components:

- Use Tokio for async/await and concurrent initialization
- Provide clean integration with the CLI's command-line parsing
- Support configuration options for appearance and behavior
- Handle terminal setup and teardown properly

## Configuration and Customization

Both implementations support configuration options:

- View mode selection (minimal, detailed, graph)
- Animation control (enabling/disabling animations)
- Accessibility options (high contrast, screen reader compatibility)
- Custom component definitions

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements include:

1. More advanced visualization modes (including animated graphs)
2. Performance metrics and optimization
3. Enhanced error recovery and self-healing
4. Deeper integration with system monitoring
5. Component-specific configuration options
6. Extended event system for component communication

## Usage

In TypeScript:
```typescript
import { runBootSequence } from './boot-sequence';

// Run with default options
await runBootSequence();

// Run with custom options
await runBootSequence({
  showUI: true,
  skipAnimation: false,
  components: myCustomComponents,
  initOptions: {
    maxParallel: 4,
    onComplete: () => console.log('Boot complete')
  }
});
```

In Rust:
```rust
use codex_cli::boot_sequence::{run_boot_sequence, run_boot_sequence_with_config, BootSequenceConfig};

// Run with default options
run_boot_sequence().await?;

// Run with custom options
let config = BootSequenceConfig {
    show_boot: true,
    skip_animation: false,
    display_mode: DisplayMode::Standard,
    accessibility_mode: AccessibilityMode::Visual,
    high_contrast: false,
    custom_components: Some(my_custom_components),
    events: vec![],
};
run_boot_sequence_with_config(config).await?;
```

## Integration Summary

The boot sequence implementations have been integrated with the Codex CLI code in both TypeScript and Rust. The implementation provides an enhanced user experience during CLI startup, with visual feedback on initialization progress and support for dependency-based component loading.
