- Implement language-agnostic relationship mapping

## Key Accomplishments

The HMS Concept Analyzer system has successfully implemented:

1. A modular Rust architecture for repository analysis
2. LLM-powered concept extraction and relationship mapping
3. A unified concept registry that spans multiple repositories
4. Intelligent gap detection with specific recommendations
5. GitHub integration for finding and evaluating OSS solutions
6. CI/CD automation for continuous concept mapping

These capabilities provide a solid foundation for understanding and improving the HMS ecosystem, enabling teams to identify gaps, discover solutions, and create a more cohesive system architecture.
