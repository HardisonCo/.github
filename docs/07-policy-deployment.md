> ‚ÄúWe merged the new `llm_policy.yaml` that lets NSF staff use OpenAI‚Äî  
> why is production still shouting **‚ÄòPlease provide API keys‚Äô**?‚Äù  
> ‚Äî DevOps retro, week 2

In Chapters 1-6 we wrote, approved, and broadcast a policy that allows NSF
analysts to tap GPT, Claude, or Gemini.  
None of that matters until **every running container, Lambda, and browser tab**
is actually **running under the new policy**.  
That final mile is handled by `_ref`‚Äôs **Policy Deployment** component.

Think of it as the **pipeline that presses ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù on Governance files** the
same way an app-store presses ‚ÄúGo Live‚Äù on mobile code.

## 1. Why Policy Deployment Fixes the NSF ‚ÄúMissing-Key‚Äù Bug

Concrete moment:

1. Governance repo adds `openai` block to `llm_policy.yaml`  
   (`daily_budget_usd: 50`, `allowed_roles: [nsf_research_staff]`).  
2. Carol the security engineer **approves** the change in `_ref` HITL.  
3. *If* Policy Deployment runs,  
   ‚Ä¢ the file is versioned, signed, shipped to prod, and  
   ‚Ä¢ the Management layer can finally fetch and rotate keys.  
4. Analyst clicks **Generate Research Summary** and succeeds.  

*If Policy Deployment stalls*, servers keep reading the **old** policy that has
no `openai` stanza, and the error banner lives on forever.

## 2. Key Concepts in Plain English

| Piece                | What It Does for NSF                                                      |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Package Builder      | Wraps changed files + metadata into a versioned **tarball** (`PD-23.1`).  |
| Integrity Signer     | Adds SHA-256 + GPG signature so prod trusts it.                           |
| Distribution Engine  | Ships the tarball to every environment (dev ‚Üí staging ‚Üí prod).           |
| Adoption Monitor     | Polls each target, waits for ‚Äú‚úîÔ∏è policy 23.1 loaded‚Äù.                     |
| Rollback Switch      | One command restores the previous version if error rates spike.          |
| Immutable Log        | Stores every byte & timestamp for Inspector-General audits.              |

Remember: **Package ‚Üí Ship ‚Üí Watch ‚Üí Revert (if needed)**.

## 3. How to Use It (NSF Example)

### 3.1 Trigger a Deployment from CLI (14 chars + newline)

```bash
hms deploy llm_policy.yaml
```

Behind that single command `_ref`:

1. Reads `governance/llm_policy.yaml`.  
2. Calculates the next semantic version (`23.1.0`).  
3. Starts the Distribution Engine.

CLI output:

```
‚úî packaged as PD-23.1.0
‚úî signature valid (GPG A13F‚Ä¶)
‚ü≥ deploying to dev‚Ä¶ staging‚Ä¶ prod‚Ä¶
‚úî all targets acknowledged
```

### 3.2 Programmatic Trigger (Python, ‚â§ 18 lines)

```python
# deploy_llm_policy.py
from hms_deploy import deploy_policy

deploy_id = deploy_policy(
    file_path="governance/llm_policy.yaml",
    reason="Enable OpenAI GPT for nsf_research_staff"
)
print(deploy_id)   # ‚Üí 'PD-23.1.0'
```

Input: path + human reason  
Output: deployment ID for dashboards & rollbacks.

## 4. What Happens Internally?

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Dev as DevOps Engineer
    participant GOV as Governance Git
    participant PD  as Policy Deployment
    participant S3  as Artifact Store
    participant ENV as Prod Cluster
    participant BUS as RT-Sync Bus

    Dev->>PD: hms deploy llm_policy.yaml
    PD->>GOV: pull latest commit
    PD->>S3: upload PD-23.1.0.tgz + sig
    PD->>ENV: webhook /reload?ver=PD-23.1.0
    ENV-->>PD: 200 OK (applied)
    PD->>BUS: emit policyChanged v=PD-23.1.0
    PD-->>Dev: success + log link
```

Key NSF-specific notes:

* **S3 Artifact Store** = FIPS-compliant bucket in AWS GovCloud.  
* **ENV** includes HMS-API, AI Agent containers, and web front-ends.  
* The **policyChanged** event re-uses the Real-Time Sync bus from Chapter 6,
  so every running process reloads config without a restart.

## 5. Mini Source Tour (‚â§ 20 Lines Each)

### 5.1 Package & Sign

```python
# hms_deploy/builder.py
import tarfile, hashlib, gnupg, time
def build(src):
    ver = f"PD-{int(time.time())}"
    tar = f"/tmp/{ver}.tgz"
    with tarfile.open(tar, "w:gz") as t:
        t.add(src, arcname="llm_policy.yaml")
    sha = hashlib.sha256(open(tar,'rb').read()).hexdigest()
    sig = gnupg.GPG().sign(sha)          # assumes keyring pre-loaded
    return tar, sig.data, ver
```

### 5.2 Distribute & Verify

```python
# hms_deploy/distribute.py
def push(tar, sig, ver, targets):
    for host in targets:
        r = requests.post(f"{host}/reload",
                          files={"pkg": open(tar,'rb'),"sig":sig},
                          timeout=5)
        assert r.status_code == 200, f"{host} failed"
```

Both snippets are toy-sized but show the **build ‚Üí push ‚Üí verify** loop.

## 6. Touch-Points with Other HMS Components

Component | Interaction in This Chapter
----------|-----------------------------
[Three-Layer Architecture](01_three_layer_architecture_governance_management_interface_.md) | Moves files from **Governance** repo to **Management** services.
[HITL Cockpit](02_human_in_the_loop_hitl_decision_maker_engagement_.md) | Only policies *approved* in HITL are eligible for deployment.
[Backend API (‚ÄúHeart‚Äù)](05_backend_api_heart_communication_hub_.md) | Receives `/reload?ver=` hook, reloads policy into memory.
[Real-Time Sync](06_real_time_synchronization_event_broadcast_.md) | Broadcasts `policyChanged` so browsers & agents hot-reload.
[Verification Mechanism](08_verification_mechanism_conveyor_belt_ci_gate_.md) | Next chapter runs post-deploy smoke tests before we mark the roll-out ‚Äúdone‚Äù.

## 7. Analogy Corner üì®

Policy Deployment is the **postal service‚Äôs sorting center**:

1. **Package** a new federal circular (build + sign).  
2. **Route** it to every post office (distribute).  
3. **Check** each office signs the register (adoption monitor).  
4. Keep trucks idling nearby in case the circular was mis-printed (rollback).

Only after every desk clerk has the updated book does the public (NSF analysts)
benefit‚Äîno more ‚Äúplease provide API keys.‚Äù

---

## 8. Recap & Next Steps

By pressing one command, Policy Deployment:

‚úîÔ∏è Versioned the updated `llm_policy.yaml`  
‚úîÔ∏è Shipped it securely to all NSF environments  
‚úîÔ∏è Triggered live reloads so the Management layer can finally hand out keys  
‚úîÔ∏è Logged every byte for future audits

System functionality gap closed; the key policy is **live everywhere**.

But how do we make sure nothing broke during the roll-out?  
Chapter 8 introduces the **Verification Mechanism (Conveyor-Belt CI Gate)** that
runs automatic smoke tests‚Äîcatching issues before analysts notice.
