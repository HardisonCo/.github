- [ ] Create feature list and requirements specification

#### Architecture Planning
- [ ] Design component architecture diagram
- [ ] Document data flows and integration points
- [ ] Define security model and compliance requirements
- [ ] Plan scaling and performance characteristics
- [ ] Document dependencies on other HMS components

### 2. Implementation Phase

#### Repository Setup
- [ ] Create HMS-[NAME] directory following naming convention
- [ ] Initialize appropriate project structure based on tech stack
- [ ] Set up build system and dependency management

- [ ] Implement standardized project structure

#### Core Implementation
- [ ] Implement core functionality with appropriate test coverage
- [ ] Create API interfaces following HMS standards
- [ ] Implement security measures following HMS requirements

#### Integration Implementation
- [ ] Create integration points with dependent HMS components
- [ ] Implement data exchange mechanisms
- [ ] Add event handlers or message consumers as needed
- [ ] Implement API clients for required HMS services
- [ ] Create service discovery mechanisms if needed

### 3. Documentation Phase

#### Component Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md following HMS standards:
  - Component name and purpose
  - Architecture diagram showing position in HMS ecosystem
  - Installation and setup instructions
  - Usage examples
  - API documentation
  - Testing procedures
  - Contribution guidelines
  - License information

#### Additional Documentation
- [ ] Create detailed API documentation

- [ ] Create developer guides for component extension
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guides for common issues

#### Integration Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update documentation in related HMS components
- [ ] Add references to new component in system architecture docs
- [ ] Update dependency documentation in affected components
- [ ] Add API client usage examples in dependent components

### 4. Testing and Validation Phase

#### Testing
- [ ] Implement unit tests with high coverage
- [ ] Create integration tests with dependent components
- [ ] Perform security testing and validation
- [ ] Conduct performance and load testing
- [ ] Test deployment process and configuration

#### Review Process
- [ ] Conduct code review
- [ ] Perform documentation review
- [ ] Validate against architectural standards
- [ ] Test integration with dependent components
- [ ] Verify compliance with HMS standards

### 5. Deployment Phase

#### Preparing for Production
- [ ] Create deployment documentation
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerting configuration
- [ ] Create backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Document scaling procedures
- [ ] Add operations runbook

#### Release Process
- [ ] Create release notes
- [ ] Update system documentation
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Validate in staging
- [ ] Deploy to production

## Standards and Best Practices

### Directory Structure
All HMS components should follow a consistent directory structure:

```
HMS-[NAME]/
  ├── README.md             # Main documentation
  ├── CONTRIBUTING.md       # Contribution guidelines
  ├── LICENSE               # License information
  ├── docs/                 # Detailed documentation
  │   ├── index.md          # Documentation home
  │   ├── architecture.md   # Architecture details
  │   └── api.md            # API documentation
  ├── src/                  # Source code
  ├── tests/                # Test code
  ├── examples/             # Example usage
  └── [build files]         # Build configuration
```

### Documentation Standards
Documentation should include:

1. **Clear Purpose Statement**: What problem does this component solve?
2. **Architecture Diagram**: Visual representation of component in HMS ecosystem
3. **Setup Instructions**: Clear steps for installation and configuration
4. **API Documentation**: Clear documentation of public interfaces
5. **Integration Guide**: How to integrate with other HMS components
6. **Example Usage**: Code examples showing common use cases
7. **Testing Information**: How to run tests and validate functionality

### Coding Standards
- Follow language-specific best practices (Python: PEP 8, JS/TS: ESLint)
- Use type hints/TypeScript interfaces for improved developer experience
- Include comprehensive unit tests
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow HMS naming conventions for consistency

## Implementation Checklist

A new HMS component should meet the following criteria before production release:

- [ ] Comprehensive README.md following HMS template
- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] Integration documentation for other components
- [ ] Unit test coverage meeting HMS standards (min 80%)
- [ ] Integration tests with dependent components
- [ ] Security analysis completed
- [ ] Performance testing completed
- [ ] All dependencies documented
- [ ] Build and deployment scripts implemented
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configured
- [ ] Release notes created

## Conclusion

Following this standardized process ensures that new HMS components are developed, documented, and integrated consistently, maintaining the architectural integrity of the overall system while enabling extensibility and scalability.
