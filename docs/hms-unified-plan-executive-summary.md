The HMS architecture introduces a unified supervisor-driven structure that coordinates specialized components through a hierarchical approach:

1. **Enhanced Supervisor Hierarchy**
   - Meta-Supervisor as central orchestration point
   - Specialized supervisors for runtime, analysis, verification, GA, FFI, etc.
   - New Economic-Theorem-Supervisor for theorem-proving activities

2. **Specialized Agent System**
   - Core agent framework with pluggable skills (AGT/AGX)
   - New theorem-specific agents: Decomposition, Strategy, Verification
   - Advanced genetic agents with evolution capabilities

3. **Integration & Communication**
   - Standardized A2A protocol for agent coordination
   - FFI layer for Rust-Python interoperability
   - Self-healing mesh for automatic recovery

4. **Theorem Proving Infrastructure**
   - Lean Prover integration for formal verification
   - Economic axiom library and theorem repository
   - Hybrid GA-RL approach for optimization
