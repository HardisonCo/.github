## Documentation Approach

For each agency, the following files must be created in both paths:

### US Path
- `/path/to/docs/us/federal/[agency_id]/index.md`
- `/path/to/docs/us/federal/[agency_id]/01_agency_information.md`
- `/path/to/docs/us/federal/[agency_id]/02_stakeholders.md`
- `/path/to/docs/us/federal/[agency_id]/03_legacy_challenges.md`
- `/path/to/docs/us/federal/[agency_id]/04_use_cases.md`
- `/path/to/docs/us/federal/[agency_id]/05_hms_integration.md`
- `/path/to/docs/us/federal/[agency_id]/06_getting_started.md`

### Domestic Path
- `/path/to/docs/domestic/federal/[agency_id]/index.md`
- `/path/to/docs/domestic/federal/[agency_id]/01_agency_information.md`
- `/path/to/docs/domestic/federal/[agency_id]/02_stakeholders.md`
- `/path/to/docs/domestic/federal/[agency_id]/03_legacy_challenges.md`
- `/path/to/docs/domestic/federal/[agency_id]/04_use_cases.md`
- `/path/to/docs/domestic/federal/[agency_id]/05_hms_integration.md`
- `/path/to/docs/domestic/federal/[agency_id]/06_getting_started.md`

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Waves Approach**: Implement agencies in waves of 5-10 at a time
2. **Priority Order**: Follow the priority categories, starting with remaining Cabinet-level departments
3. **Research First**: Gather comprehensive information about each agency before starting documentation
4. **Template Reuse**: Leverage patterns from completed agencies while ensuring unique agency-specific content
5. **Cross-Reference**: Ensure consistent integration points between related agencies
6. **Quality Control**: Review each completed agency for completeness and accuracy
7. **Continuous Progress**: Update tracker regularly with completion status

## Completion Targets

| Priority Group | Target Completion | Agencies | Status |
|----------------|-------------------|----------|--------|
| Priority 1 (Cabinet) | 2024-06-30 | 10 | 0% Complete |
| Priority 2 (Major Independent) | 2024-07-31 | 15 | 0% Complete |
| Priority 3 (Financial/Regulatory) | 2024-08-31 | 15 | 0% Complete |
| Priority 4 (Security/Intelligence) | 2024-09-30 | 10 | 0% Complete |
| Priority 5 (Health/Science) | 2024-10-31 | 15 | 0% Complete |
| Priority 6 (Administrative) | 2024-11-30 | 15 | 0% Complete |
| Priority 7 (Remaining) | 2024-12-31 | 30 | 0% Complete |
| **TOTAL** | | **115** | **4.3% Complete** |

## Next Steps

1. Begin documenting the HHS implementation as the next Priority 1 agency
2. Create templates for each file type based on successful patterns from completed agencies
3. Establish research protocol for gathering agency-specific information
4. Set up quality control review process for completed documentation
5. Implement progress reporting dashboard
