## To complete the full list of 193 agencies
To create a complete list of 193 international public health agencies, we would need to:

1. Include the national public health agency from each UN member state (193 countries)
2. Add major regional agencies
3. Include specialized international health organizations

For each country, we would typically focus on the equivalent of:
- National public health institute/agency
- Ministry/Department of Health
- Disease control/surveillance agency
- Health regulatory authority
- National research institute for public health

This would provide us with at least one official health agency per country, plus the major international and regional organizations, reaching the target of 193 international public health agencies.
