# Economic Theorem Prover with Self-Healing Genetic Agents

## Overview

The Economic Theorem Prover is a sophisticated platform that combines formal theorem proving with genetic algorithm optimization to verify and explore economic theories. The system leverages DeepSeek-Prover-V2 integration and self-healing capabilities to ensure robust, continuous operation while optimizing proof strategies through evolutionary computation.

## Key Components

### 1. Core Theorem Proving System

- **Proof Engine**: A robust engine that processes theorem proving requests and manages the proof process
- **Theorem Repository**: Centralized storage and management of economic theorems with versioning
- **Lean 4 Integration**: Custom tactics and formalization libraries specific to economic domains
- **FFI Layer**: Foreign Function Interface connecting Rust and Python components
- **DeepSeek-Prover-V2 Integration**: Leveraging advanced AI-powered theorem proving capabilities

### 2. Economic Model

The core economic model implements the Moneyball-Buffett approach with three main domains:

- **Trade Analysis** - Calculates Weighted Agreement Return (WAR) scores
- **Deficit Analysis** - Computes Deficit Reduction Potential (DRP)
- **Sector Prioritization** - Determines Sector Prioritization Scores (SPS)

### 3. Genetic Algorithm Optimization

The genetic algorithm framework optimizes theorem proving strategies with:

- **Advanced Mutation Operators**:
  - `GaussianMutation`: Applies Gaussian noise to numerical parameters
  - `AdaptiveMutation`: Self-adjusting mutation rates based on fitness progress
  - `MultiPointMutation`: Simultaneously modifies multiple aspects of complex traits

- **Advanced Crossover Operations**:
  - `TournamentSelection`: Select parents based on fitness tournament
  - `NichePreservationCrossover`: Maintains strategy diversity across problem domains
  - `MultiPointCrossover`: Combines successful traits from different strategies

- **Multi-Objective Fitness Evaluation**:
  - `MultiObjectiveFitness`: Evaluates strategies across multiple weighted objectives
  - Domain-specific objectives (proof speed, proof clarity, generalizability)
  - Dynamic fitness weighting based on problem characteristics

- **Population Management**:
  - `IslandModel`: Parallel evolution of isolated strategy populations
  - `DiversityPreservation`: Mechanisms to maintain genetic diversity
  - Advanced population initialization strategies

### 4. Economic-Specific Theorem Tactics

- **Core Economic Tactics**:
  - Utility maximization tactics
  - Market clearing mechanisms
  - Welfare theorems

- **Microeconomics Tactics**:
  - Consumer choice optimization
  - Producer theory tactics
  - Market equilibrium analysis

- **Game Theory Tactics**:
  - Nash equilibrium verification
  - Dominant strategy identification
  - Best response analysis

- **Mechanism Design Tactics**:
  - Incentive compatibility verification
  - Mechanism efficiency proofs
  - VCG mechanism tactics

### 5. Self-Healing System

The system includes advanced self-healing capabilities:

- **Anomaly Detection**:
  - `TimeSeriesAnomalyDetector`: Identifies abnormal patterns in metrics
  - `LogAnomalyDetector`: Detects error patterns in system logs
  - `BehavioralAnomalyDetector`: Monitors component interactions

- **Recovery Strategies**:
  - `RestartComponentStrategy`: Restarts failing components
  - `CircuitBreakerStrategy`: Prevents cascading failures
  - `ReconfigurationStrategy`: Adjusts system parameters
  - `GeneticRecoveryStrategy`: Evolves optimal recovery parameters

- **Self-Healing Coordinator**:
  - Central orchestration of detection and recovery
  - Multiple operation modes (manual, supervised, automated, learning)
  - Recovery prioritization and approval workflow

### 6. Metrics Collection and Visualization

- **Metrics Collection**: Various metric types including counters, gauges, histograms, timers, and events
- **Metrics Storage**: Time-series storage with efficient querying and anomaly detection
- **Visualization Dashboard**: Web-based dashboard for system monitoring and performance analysis

## Key Economic Theorems

The system can prove a wide range of economic theorems, including:

1. **Utility Maximization**: Proves first-order conditions for utility maximization
2. **Nash Equilibrium**: Verifies Nash equilibrium properties in game theory scenarios
3. **Mechanism Design**: Validates incentive compatibility in mechanism designs
4. **WAR Score Bounds**: Proves that WAR scores are bounded between -100 and 100
5. **DRP Conservative**: Verifies that DRP calculations are always conservative estimates
6. **SPS Bounds**: Confirms that SPS scores are bounded between 0 and 100

## Usage Examples

### Basic Theorem Proving

```python
from economic_theorem_prover import Client

# Create client
client = Client(api_key="your_api_key")

# Prove a theorem
result = client.theorems.prove("theorem-utility-maximization", optimize=True)

# Get proof details
proof = client.proof_jobs.get(result.proof_job_id)

# Check if successful
if proof.result.success:
    print(f"Theorem proven in {proof.result.time_ms}ms using {proof.result.proof_steps} steps")
else:
    print("Theorem could not be proven")
```

### Economic Model Integration

```rust
// Create an economic theorem prover
let config = EconomicTheoremProverConfig::default();
let mut prover = EconomicTheoremProver::new(config).await;

// Create economic input data
let trade_analysis = TradeAnalysisInput::new(
    vec![("Energy".to_string(), 0.3), ("Technology".to_string(), 0.7)],
    vec![("Energy".to_string(), 60.0), ("Technology".to_string(), 40.0)],
    vec![("Energy".to_string(), 0.5), ("Technology".to_string(), 0.8)]
).unwrap();

// Prove WAR score bounds theorem
let result = prover.prove_war_score_bounds(&trade_analysis).await;
println!("Theorem proved: {}", result.success);
```

### Self-Healing Configuration

```python
# Initialize the self-healing system
from economic_theorem_prover.self_healing import initialize_self_healing

self_healing = initialize_self_healing({
    'enabled': True,
    'mode': 'supervised',
    'detection_interval': 30,
    'dashboard_enabled': True,
    'dashboard_port': 8080
})

# Start the self-healing system
self_healing.start()
```
