# HMS Monitoring System Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the HMS Monitoring System, which integrates:
1. Self-Healing
2. TMUX Visualization
3. Knowledge Registry

## 1. Issue Analysis and Resolution Plan

### 1.1 Self-Healing Crate Issues

The current `hms-self-healing` crate has several code conflicts and issues that need to be resolved:

1. **Naming Conflicts**: 
   - `Timer` is defined both as a trait and a struct
   - `MetricsCollector` is defined both as a trait and a struct

2. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - `regex` crate is used but not properly included in dependencies

3. **Type System Errors**:
   - Incorrect use of trait objects
   - Generic argument issues in `Result` type

### 1.2 Resolution Steps for Self-Healing Issues

1. **Rename Conflicting Types**:
   - Rename `struct Timer` to `TimerImpl`
   - Rename `struct MetricsCollector` to `MetricsCollectorImpl` 

2. **Fix Dependency Issues**:
   - Add `regex` dependency to `Cargo.toml`

3. **Fix Type System Issues**:
   - Correct trait object usage with `dyn` keyword
   - Fix generic argument usage in `Result` type

## 2. TMUX Integration Implementation

The TMUX integration component has been partially implemented, but needs the following improvements:

1. **Connection with Self-Healing**:
   - Add adapters to display self-healing events in TMUX
   - Create standard visualization formats for different event types

2. **Enhanced Visualization**:
   - Add component status visualization
   - Add real-time metrics graphs
   - Create customizable dashboard layouts

3. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Add secure command sanitization for TMUX
   - Implement permission checks for actions

## 3. Knowledge Registry Implementation

The Knowledge Registry still needs to be fully implemented:

1. **Schema Implementation**:
   - Define core schemas for strategy storage
   - Create validation rules for knowledge items
   - Implement schema versioning

2. **Storage System**:
   - Create persistent storage for knowledge items
   - Implement query engine
   - Add indexing for efficient retrieval

3. **Learning System**:
   - Implement feedback collection system
   - Create strategy evolution algorithms
   - Add adaptive optimization based on historical data

## 4. Integration Plan

### 4.1 Component Integration

1. **Self-Healing + TMUX Integration**:
   - Create event hooks in self-healing to send display updates
   - Build TMUX layouts specific to healing activities

2. **Self-Healing + Knowledge Registry**:
   - Store healing strategies in knowledge registry
   - Pull adaptive strategies based on component state

3. **TMUX + Knowledge Registry**:
   - Create knowledge browsing interface in TMUX
   - Visualize strategy effectiveness metrics

### 4.2 Complete System Integration

1. **Central Event Bus**:
   - Implement a central event bus for communication
   - Create standardized event formats

2. **Configuration System**:
   - Create unified configuration format
   - Implement configuration validation

3. **Plugin Architecture**:
   - Design plugin system for extensibility
   - Create standard interfaces for custom components

## 5. Implementation Schedule

### 5.1 Phase 1: Foundation (2 weeks)

- Fix self-healing crate issues
- Complete standalone TMUX integration
- Implement basic knowledge registry

### 5.2 Phase 2: Integration (2 weeks)

- Connect self-healing and TMUX
- Link knowledge registry with self-healing
- Create central event bus

### 5.3 Phase 3: Advanced Features (2 weeks)

- Implement advanced visualization in TMUX
- Add learning capabilities to knowledge registry
- Create comprehensive examples

### 5.4 Phase 4: Testing and Optimization (2 weeks)

- Conduct comprehensive testing
- Optimize performance
- Complete documentation and examples

## 6. Testing Strategy

### 6.1 Unit Testing

- Create tests for individual components
- Test edge cases and error handling
- Implement property-based tests

### 6.2 Integration Testing

- Test component interactions
- Verify event propagation
- Validate system recovery scenarios

### 6.3 System Testing

- Test complete system behavior
- Simulate failure conditions
- Measure recovery effectiveness

## 7. Immediate Next Steps

1. Create a standalone monitoring example (COMPLETED)
2. Fix the self-healing crate issues
3. Implement basic TMUX integration with self-healing
4. Create simplified knowledge registry

## 8. Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All components can be built and run without errors
2. The system can detect and visualize component failures
3. Recovery actions are properly coordinated and displayed
4. Knowledge is stored and retrieved efficiently
5. The system demonstrates learning capability from past incidents
6. Comprehensive documentation and examples are available

## 9. Documentation Plan

1. **Component Documentation**:
   - API reference for each component
   - Usage examples

2. **Integration Guides**:
   - How to integrate new components
   - Extension points and interfaces

3. **User Guides**:
   - Monitoring system operation
   - Configuration options
   - Troubleshooting guides

## 10. Conclusion

This implementation plan outlines a comprehensive approach to creating an integrated monitoring system with self-healing, visualization, and knowledge management capabilities. By following this plan, we will create a robust and extensible system that enhances the reliability and observability of the HMS platform.
