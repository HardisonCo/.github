## Cross-State HMS Initiatives

Several multi-state initiatives are leveraging HMS components for collaborative governance:

1. **Western States Health Data Consortium**
   - Participating states: California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado
   - HMS Components: HMS-UHC, HMS-EHR, HMS-NFO
   - Focus areas: Health data sharing, pandemic response coordination

2. **Eastern Transportation Alliance**
   - Participating states: New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland
   - HMS Components: HMS-MCP, HMS-SCM
   - Focus areas: Regional transportation planning, infrastructure coordination

3. **Midwest Environmental Data Exchange**
   - Participating states: Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota
   - HMS Components: HMS-NFO, HMS-ETL
   - Focus areas: Great Lakes environmental monitoring, cross-border compliance

4. **Southern States Technology Collaborative**
   - Participating states: Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia
   - HMS Components: HMS-DEV, HMS-CDF
   - Focus areas: Shared development resources, standardized technology procurement

## Conclusions and Recommendations

1. **Health agencies** are leading HMS adoption across states, with priority given to HMS-UHC and HMS-EHR components. This reflects the high value of health data sharing and service coordination.

2. **Technology agencies** in many states are implementing HMS-DEV and HMS-CDF to modernize their development practices and create standardized approaches to IT delivery.

3. **State size correlation** shows that larger states (by population) are generally more advanced in HMS implementation, with California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Michigan leading adoption.

4. **Regional patterns** indicate that West Coast and Northeast states have higher HMS adoption rates than other regions, possibly due to greater technology sector presence and interstate collaboration.

5. **Recommendations for accelerating HMS adoption**:
   - Establish funding mechanisms specifically for HMS adoption in state agencies
   - Create state-focused implementation templates based on successful deployments
   - Develop regional collaboration models to share implementation costs
   - Build HMS expertise centers within state technology agencies
   - Create incentives for cross-agency HMS adoption within states
