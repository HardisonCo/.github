# Economic Theorem Prover with Lean Integration

## Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the four-phase Lean integration plan into the HMS economic theorem prover system. The integration enables formal verification of economic theorems from the Moneyball-Buffett model using Lean 4.

## Completed Integration Components

### 1. Lean Library Implementation (Phases 1 & 2)

- Created `lean_libs/Moneyball.lean` with:
  - Core data structures and calculations (TradeAnalysisInput, DeficitAnalysisInput, SectorPrioritizationInput)
  - Finmap-based representations for WAR, DRP, and SPS calculations
  - Theorem stubs with JSON proof outlines
  - Type-checking smoke tests using #eval
  - Rich documentation and comments

### 2. Rust Integration for Lean Verification

- Enhanced `TheoremContext` with Lean-specific fields:
  - Added `lean_module` and `lean_lib_path` fields
  - Created `new_lean` constructor method
  - Added support for Lean module imports

- Updated `DeepSeekConfig` for Lean configuration:
  - Added `lean_executable_path` and `lean_lib_path` settings
  - Added configuration for timeouts and other Lean-specific parameters

- Modified `VerificationJob` for Lean support:
  - Added `use_lean` flag and `lean_timeout_ms` parameters
  - Updated constructors to detect Lean theorems

- Added Lean-specific verification methods to `DeepSeekClient`:
  - Implemented `verify_with_lean` for direct Lean verification
  - Added `generate_lean_module_file` to create Lean files for specific modules
  - Implemented `run_lean_verification` to execute Lean on proof files
  - Added statistics parsing for Lean output

### 3. Integrated Logic and Extended Domains (Phases 3 & 4)

- Implemented `Integrated` namespace in Lean with:
  - `EconomicAnalysis` structure combining trade, deficit, and sector analyses
  - Domain rules like `should_pursue_agreement` and `is_deficit_reduction_sound`
  - Prioritization functions like `prioritized_sectors`

- Added `O3` optimization primitives in Lean:
  - `OptimizationConfig` for performance settings
  - `DealHypergraph` for representing complex deal networks
  - Functions for analyzing and simulating deal networks

- Created `HMS` dashboard integration:
  - `DashboardInput` for HMS-specific metrics
  - Alternative WAR score calculation with `war_score_hms`
  - Projection functions like `project_deficit_impact_hms`

### 4. Supervisor Integration

- Updated the HMS supervisor to support Lean theorem proving:
  - Added `submit_lean_theorem_task` method
  - Enhanced `handle_theorem_proving_task` to detect and handle Lean theorems
  - Improved error handling for Lean verification errors

### 5. Demo & Testing

- Enhanced `economic_theorem_prover_demo.rs` with Lean examples:
  - Added Lean verification of WAR score bounds theorem
  - Implemented comparison of Lean vs. genetic algorithm approaches
  - Added real-time status monitoring for verification jobs

- Created Python FFI helper (`moneyball_theorem_helper.py`):
  - Implemented methods to submit theorems for proving
  - Added waiting and polling mechanisms
  - Supported concurrent verification of multiple theorems

### 6. CI Integration

- Added CI workflows to ensure Lean integration works:
  - Created `economic_theorem_ci.yml` for build and test verification
  - Added `lean_theorem_integration.yml` for testing the Lean integration
  - Set up automatic Lean syntax verification
  - Added Python FFI tests

## Master Plan Integration

The four-phase Lean integration has been incorporated into the HMS master plan:

- Sprint 3 (Weeks 7-8): Lean Library & Economic Model Integration
  - Phase 1: Core Data Structures & Calculations
  - Phase 2: Theorem Stubs with Proof Outlines
  
- Sprint 4 (Weeks 9-10): Integrated Logic & Verification Decision
  - Phase 3: Integrated Domain Logic & System Invariants
  - Phase 4: Verification Strategy Decision

## Next Steps (v0.3)

Based on the Phase 4 verification strategy decision, we recommend:

1. **Migrate to Executable Verification**:
   - Convert core data structures to subtypes with runtime constraints
   - Implement full proofs for key theorems using Mathlib's Finset/Finsupp lemmas
   - Add more sophisticated proof tactics based on genetic algorithm results

2. **Enhance O3 and HMS Integration**:
   - Implement more detailed integration with O3 optimization components
   - Add visualizations and dashboard components
   - Create a richer set of economic theorems for verification

3. **Improve Proof Generation**:
   - Enhance the genetic algorithm with Lean-specific tactics
   - Implement proof templates for common economic theorems
   - Add proof caching and reuse mechanisms

## Verification Results

Initial testing shows that the Lean integration successfully:
- Parses the Moneyball.lean file without errors
- Type-checks the economic model components
- Verifies simple economic theorem proofs
- Integrates correctly with the genetic algorithm engine
- Works with the Python FFI helper for external access

## Conclusion

The integration of Lean 4 formal verification into the economic theorem prover provides a solid foundation for verifying economic properties from the Moneyball-Buffett model. It successfully combines the power of genetic algorithms for proof search with the rigor of formal verification in Lean, creating a comprehensive system for economic theorem proving.

The modular design allows for future enhancements, such as adding more sophisticated theorem proving techniques, integrating with other HMS components, and expanding the range of economic theorems that can be verified.
