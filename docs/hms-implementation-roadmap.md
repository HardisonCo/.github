## Implementation Progress Dashboard

To track the progress of the implementation, a dashboard will be created with the following metrics:

1. **Overall Project Progress**: Percentage of completed tasks across all phases
2. **Phase-Specific Progress**: Completion percentage for each phase
3. **Milestone Status**: Completed, In Progress, or Pending for each milestone
4. **Task Status**: Completed, In Progress, or Pending for each task
5. **Test Coverage**: Code coverage percentage for implemented components
6. **Issue Tracking**: Open, In Progress, and Resolved issues
7. **Performance Metrics**: Key performance indicators for the system
8. **Risk Status**: Current assessment of identified risks

The dashboard will be updated regularly as tasks are completed and milestones are reached.
