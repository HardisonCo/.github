# HMS Documentation Cross-Reference Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the detailed approach for building a comprehensive cross-reference data model that maps relationships between healthcare entities (international, federal, and state), HMS components, and use cases. The cross-reference model will serve as a knowledge foundation to enhance documentation quality, enable efficient research, and maximize reuse of successful patterns.

## Objectives

5. Enable data-driven insights for prioritization and quality improvement
