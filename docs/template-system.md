## Introduction

[Agency] [manages/operates/coordinates] [description of agency systems and scope]. However, [agency] faces significant challenges in [primary documentation challenge], particularly when [specific constraint 1], [specific constraint 2], and [specific constraint 3] must be balanced. The PocketFlow Tutorial Codebase Knowledge system offers a transformative solution that can automatically analyze [domain]-focused codebases, identify core abstractions, and generate [adjective] documentation [that meets specific agency needs].

## Problem Statement

[Agency] faces critical challenges in documenting and maintaining knowledge about their technical systems:

* **[Challenge 1]** [brief explanation]

* **[Challenge 5]** [brief explanation]
* **[Challenge 6]** [brief explanation]
* **[Challenge 7]** [brief explanation]
* **[Challenge 8]** [brief explanation]
* **[Challenge 9]** [brief explanation]
* **[Challenge 10]** [brief explanation]

These challenges create an environment where [critical systems become increasingly difficult to maintain/other consequences], potentially compromising [agency mission/operations/services].

## Automation Approach
To generate use cases at scale, we will:

1. **Create Parameter Files**: For each agency, create a JSON file with all customization parameters:
   - Agency name, acronym, and type
   - System domain and specializations
   - Challenge set relevant to the agency
   - Stakeholder groups
   - Political factors
   - Expected benefits and metrics
   - Agent names and functions
   - Perspectives for recursive thought analysis

2. **Template Processing Script**: Develop a Python script that:
   - Takes the template and parameter file as input
   - Substitutes all placeholders with agency-specific values
   - Generates properly formatted Markdown
   - Saves to the appropriate directory structure

3. **Customization Depth Levels**:
   - Level 1: Basic substitution (agency name, domain)
   - Level 2: Context-aware substitution (domain-specific terminology)
   - Level 3: Structural adaptation (agency-specific sections)

4. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Automated validation of generated files
   - Manual review of representative samples
   - Consistency checks across agency types

## Parameter Categories

### Agency Parameters
- Full name
- Acronym
- Type (federal, state, international)
- Domain (health, transportation, etc.)
- Scale (staff size, budget, jurisdiction)
- Leadership structure

### System Parameters
- Primary systems
- Technology stack
- Modernization status
- Integration requirements
- Security classification
- User base size

### Documentation Challenges
- Legacy documentation status
- Knowledge transfer issues
- Regulatory requirements
- Technical complexity
- Resource constraints
- Current approach

### Political Context
- Oversight structure
- Budget process
- Interagency relationships
- Public visibility
- Reform initiatives
- Compliance frameworks

### Value Metrics
- Efficiency gains
- Cost savings
- Risk reduction
- Service improvement
- Staff productivity
- Compliance enhancement

## Implementation Plan
1. Develop and test template with 5 diverse agencies
2. Refine parameters based on test results
3. Create parameter files for all agencies
4. Develop and test automation script
5. Generate first batch (federal agencies)
6. Review and refine
7. Generate second batch (state agencies)
8. Review and refine
9. Generate third batch (international agencies)
10. Final QA and publication

This approach will allow us to efficiently generate hundreds of high-quality, consistent yet customized use cases that demonstrate how PocketFlow can address the specific documentation needs of different government agencies.
