4. **Backward Compatibility**: Minimize disruption to existing HMS components and workflows.
5. **Test-Driven Development**: Develop comprehensive test suites alongside implementation code.
6. **Documentation-First**: Document interfaces, protocols, and behaviors before implementation.
7. **Verification-First**: Apply the HMS Verification-First Framework to all supervisor components.

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to developing the HMS Supervisor Architecture over a 20-week period. By following this phased approach, we can incrementally build, test, and deploy the supervisor components while maintaining integration with existing HMS systems. The plan addresses technical implementation details, cross-cutting concerns, and organizational considerations to ensure successful delivery.

Regular reviews at each milestone will ensure the implementation remains aligned with the architectural vision and business requirements. Adjustments to the plan may be necessary as development progresses and as we learn more about the interactions between supervisors and existing HMS components.
