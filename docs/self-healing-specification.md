# HMS Self-Healing System Specification

## 1. Introduction

The HMS Self-Healing System is a comprehensive framework for adding resilience and automatic recovery capabilities to HMS components. This specification defines the architecture, interfaces, and behaviors of the self-healing system.

## 2. Core Principles

1. **Fail-Fast, Recover-Fast** - Detect issues early and recover quickly to minimize impact
2. **Progressive Recovery** - Start with lightweight recovery actions, progressively escalate if needed
3. **Adaptive Learning** - Learn from previous failures to optimize future recovery strategies
4. **Context-Aware Healing** - Consider component relationships and system state during recovery
5. **Component Autonomy** - Allow components to self-heal locally when possible

## 3. System Components

### 3.1 Unified Interface

All self-healing implementations expose a common interface:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait SelfHealing: Send + Sync {
    async fn initialize(&mut self) -> Result<()>;
    async fn check_health(&self) -> Result<HealthStatus>;
    async fn heal(&mut self) -> Result<HealingAction>;
    async fn health_metrics(&self) -> Result<HealthMetrics>;
    async fn apply_config(&mut self, config: AdaptiveConfig) -> Result<()>;
}
```

### 3.2 Healing Levels

Three healing levels are available to match component requirements:

1. **Basic** - Traditional self-healing with circuit breakers and recovery strategies
2. **Advanced** - Hybrid approach combining traditional and genetic algorithm approaches
3. **Full** - Sophisticated genetic algorithm and multi-agent approach to self-healing

### 3.3 Factory Creation

Components create a self-healing instance appropriate to their needs:

```rust
// Basic healing for simple components
let healing = create_basic_self_healing("component-id");

// Advanced healing for important components
let healing = create_advanced_self_healing("component-id");

// Full healing for critical components
let healing = create_full_self_healing("component-id");
```

### 3.4 Core Subsystems

#### 3.4.1 Circuit Breaker

Provides failure isolation to prevent cascading failures:

- Tracks failure rates and thresholds
- Transitions between Closed, Open, and Half-Open states
- Prevents operations during Open state
- Gradually tests recovery with Half-Open state

#### 3.4.2 Recovery Management

Coordinates recovery strategies for different issues:

- Matches issues to appropriate strategies
- Manages strategy prioritization and execution
- Tracks recovery history and effectiveness
- Implements progressive escalation for persistent issues

#### 3.4.3 Health Monitoring

Tracks component health and detects anomalies:

- Collects and analyzes metrics
- Determines overall health status
- Identifies issues requiring recovery
- Provides historical health data

#### 3.4.4 Genetic Optimization (Advanced & Full levels)

Evolves and optimizes recovery strategies:

- Represents recovery strategies as evolvable genes
- Evaluates strategy effectiveness as fitness function
- Evolves more effective strategies over time
- Adapts to changing system conditions

## 4. Implementation Types

### 4.1 Standalone Implementation

Used for Basic healing level:

- Traditional circuit breaker pattern
- Explicit recovery strategies
- Threshold-based anomaly detection
- Lower resource requirements

### 4.2 A2A Implementation

Used for Full healing level:

- Genetic algorithm optimization
- Multi-agent coordination
- Learning from historical incidents
- Adaptive configuration evolution

### 4.3 Hybrid Implementation

Used for Advanced healing level:

- Combines both implementations
- Starts with Standalone for efficiency
- Falls back to A2A for complex issues
- Balances resource usage and sophistication

## 5. Integration & Extension

### 5.1 Component Integration

Components integrate self-healing by:

1. Creating a self-healing instance with appropriate level
2. Initializing the instance during startup
3. Regularly checking health status
4. Reporting metrics to enable anomaly detection
5. Allowing automatic healing when issues are detected

### 5.2 Custom Recovery Strategies

Components can implement custom recovery strategies:

```rust
#[async_trait]
impl RecoveryStrategy for CustomStrategy {
    fn name(&self) -> &str { "custom-strategy" }
    
    fn can_handle(&self, issue: &Issue) -> bool {
        // Logic to determine if strategy applies
    }
    
    async fn recover(&self, issue: &Issue) -> Result<HealingAction> {
        // Custom recovery implementation
    }
    
    fn priority(&self) -> u32 { 10 }
    
    fn level(&self) -> RecoveryLevel { RecoveryLevel::Medium }
}
```

### 5.3 Cross-Language Integration

Self-healing capabilities are accessible from multiple languages:

- Rust native implementation
- TypeScript integration via FFI
- Python integration via FFI
- Go integration via FFI

## 6. Configuration & Adaptation

### 6.1 Static Configuration

Components configure self-healing behavior through `UnifiedHealingConfig`:

```rust
UnifiedHealingConfig {
    component_id: "my-component".to_string(),
    level: HealingLevel::Advanced,
    auto_healing_enabled: true,
    circuit_breaker_enabled: true,
    healing_timeout: 30,
    implementation_config: ImplementationConfig::Hybrid(HashMap::new()),
}
```

### 6.2 Adaptive Configuration

Self-healing behavior can be adapted at runtime:

```rust
let mut parameters = HashMap::new();
parameters.insert(
    "circuit_breaker".to_string(), 
    serde_json::json!({
        "failure_threshold": 10,
        "reset_timeout": 60
    })
);

let adaptive_config = AdaptiveConfig {
    parameters,
    source: "optimization".to_string(),
    timestamp: SystemTime::now(),
};

healing.apply_config(adaptive_config).await?;
```

### 6.3 Evolutionary Adaptation (Advanced & Full levels)

Advanced and Full healing levels support genetic optimization:

- Recovery strategies evolve based on effectiveness
- Configuration parameters optimize over time
- System adapts to changing conditions
- Learning from historical incidents informs future strategy

## 7. Metrics & Observability

### 7.1 Health Status

Components report health as one of four states:

- `Healthy` - Normal operation
- `Degraded(reason)` - Operating with reduced capability
- `Critical(reason)` - At risk of failure
- `Failed(reason)` - No longer functioning

### 7.2 Health Metrics

Standard metrics collected for all components:

- CPU usage percentage
- Memory usage in MB
- Response time in milliseconds
- Error rate percentage
- Throughput in requests per second
- Custom component-specific metrics

### 7.3 Healing Actions

Recovery actions are tracked and categorized:

- `NoAction` - No action was needed
- `ConfigAdjusted(details)` - Configuration was changed
- `Restarted` - Component was restarted
- `ResourcesScaled(details)` - Resources were adjusted
- `ReconnectionAttempted(success)` - Connection was retried
- `FallbackActivated(details)` - Fallback mechanism was used
- `Custom(details)` - Component-specific action

## 8. Best Practices

### 8.1 Component Guidelines

1. Choose the appropriate healing level based on component criticality
2. Initialize self-healing early in component lifecycle
3. Report accurate and timely metrics
