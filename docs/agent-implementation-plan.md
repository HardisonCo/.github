# HMS Agent Implementation Plan

This document outlines the strategy for implementing the agent-based system component architecture in the HMS ecosystem, where each HMS-* component has its own dedicated intelligent agent responsible for that component's management, development, and integration.

## Core Principles

1. **Agent Autonomy**: Each component agent has full responsibility for its domain
2. **Verification Over Debate**: External validators over multi-LLM verification
3. **Chain of Recursive Thoughts (CoRT)**: Structured reasoning for complex decisions
4. **Standardized Interfaces**: Well-defined protocols for agent collaboration
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Background processes for system optimization

## Agent Onboarding Process

The 5-pass approach for teaching agents about component codebases:

### Pass 1: High-Level Understanding
- Gather project purpose, scope, and user base
- Identify technology stack and dependencies
- Determine architectural patterns and frameworks
- Map directory structure and code organization
- Locate entry points and cross-cutting concerns

### Pass 2: Component-Specific Analysis
- Customize first pass analysis for the specific technology stack
- Generate detailed component architecture documentation
- Identify component-specific patterns and practices
- Document build, test, and deployment processes
- Map internal module relationships

### Pass 3: Ecosystem Integration
- Document component's role in the HMS ecosystem
- Map integration points with other components
- Identify shared resources and dependencies
- Document communication patterns and protocols
- Analyze domain-specific knowledge requirements

### Pass 4: Development Process Integration
- Document component development workflow
- Integrate with HMS-DEV processes
- Map documentation generation with HMS-DOC
- Establish testing and verification procedures
- Document deployment and release processes

### Pass 5: Optimization and Collaboration
- Implement HITL/RLHF training for the component agent
- Establish issue tracking and resolution procedures
- Document collaboration patterns with other agents
- Optimize internal sub-agent organization
- Implement Chain of Recursive Thoughts for complex decisions

## Agent Collaboration Model

### Primary Collaboration Patterns

1. **Request-Response**: Simple task delegation with completion acknowledgment
   ```
   AgentA -> Request information -> AgentB
   AgentB -> Provide response -> AgentA
   ```

2. **Expert Consultation**: Delegating specialized tasks to component experts
   ```
   AgentA -> Request specialized task -> AgentB
   AgentB -> Perform task with domain expertise
   AgentB -> Return results with verification -> AgentA
   ```

3. **Collaborative Development**: Multi-agent work on cross-component features
   ```
   AgentA -> Initiate collaboration -> AgentB, AgentC
   All agents -> Coordinate through shared context
   All agents -> Contribute component-specific implementations
   All agents -> Jointly verify integration
   ```

4. **Supervisor Optimization**: Background process improvements
   ```
   SupervisorAgent -> Monitor system performance
   SupervisorAgent -> Identify optimization opportunities
   SupervisorAgent -> Coordinate improvements across agents
   All agents -> Implement optimizations in their domains
   ```

### Verification-First Principle

The HMS agent system prioritizes sound verification over multi-LLM debates:

1. Each task must have appropriate verification mechanisms
2. Verification is treated as more challenging than generation
3. External validators (tests, linters, etc.) are preferred over LLM cross-checking
4. Each component agent is responsible for implementing domain-appropriate validators
5. Integration points require explicit verification protocols

## HMS-DEV Integration

The HMS-DEV component provides critical infrastructure for the agent system:

1. Development environment standardization
2. Tool orchestration and workflow management
3. Pomodoro-style work session coordination
4. Background optimization processes
5. Agent collaboration facilitation

All component agents interact with the HMS-DEV agent for development tasks, ensuring consistent practices and tools across the system.

## Implementing Chain of Recursive Thoughts (CoRT)

Based on [Chain-of-Recursive-Thoughts](https://github.com/PhialsBasement/Chain-of-Recursive-Thoughts), the HMS implementation will:

1. Break complex problems into well-defined sub-problems
2. Maintain an explicit reasoning tree with:
   - Problem definition
   - Approach justification
   - Alternative considerations
   - Verification mechanisms
3. Allow agents to recursively refine their reasoning
4. Implement checkpoints for validation and course correction
5. Maintain auditability of the decision process

Each component agent will implement CoRT adapted to its domain-specific requirements.

## Conclusion

The HMS agent implementation plan establishes a robust framework for component-specific intelligent agents that manage their domains autonomously while collaborating through standardized interfaces. By prioritizing sound verification over debate-based approaches, and implementing Chain of Recursive Thoughts for complex reasoning, the system aims to deliver reliable, maintainable, and continuously improving software components.

This agent-based architecture enables each HMS component to evolve independently while maintaining cohesive integration with the broader ecosystem, ultimately delivering a more adaptive and resilient system.
