## 2. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Data Structures (Days 1-2)

1. Implement the core Lean 4 data structures:
   - `TradeAnalysisInput`, `DeficitAnalysisInput`, `SectorPrioritizationInput`
   - Implement `lookupD` helper for finmap-style operations
   - Define core calculation functions: `warScore`, `drp`, `sps`

2. Add constraints and validation:
   - Define predicates like `sumWeightsEqOne`, `bounded`, `nonneg`
   - Add struct fields to hold constraint information

### Phase 2: Theorem Framework (Days 3-4)

1. Define theorem stubs:
   - `warScore_bounds`, `drp_conservative`, `sps_bounds`
   - Outline proof sketches following JSON "proof_outline"

2. Create genetic representation:
   - Define chromosome encoding for proof strategies
   - Implement tactic genes specialized for economic theorems
   - Create proof strategy generation functions

### Phase 3: Integrated Domain Logic (Days 5-6)

1. Implement integrated system invariants:
   - Define multi-domain rules as composite Props
   - Create combined constraints across domains

2. Connect to genetic algorithm engine:
   - Implement specialized fitness functions for economic theorems
   - Create mutation operators optimized for Moneyball theorem spaces

### Phase 4: Extended Domains (Days 7-8)

1. Implement O3 Deal Optimization primitives:
   - Create `DealHypergraph` and optimization structs
   - Implement `o3_optimize_deals` and Monte Carlo simulation
   - Add caching and performance optimizations

2. Add HMS Trade System components:
   - Implement `HMSDashboardInput` and related structures
   - Add alternative calculation methods (`war_score_hms`)
   - Create projection utilities (`project_deficit_impact_hms`)

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing (Days 9-10)

1. Combine all components:
   - Integrate with DeepSeek-Prover-V2 pipeline
   - Set up genetic algorithm execution for theorem proving
   - Create supervisor interface for economic theorem verification

2. Testing and verification:
   - Create test cases based on JSON examples
   - Validate theorem validation with DeepSeek-Prover-V2
   - Benchmark performance optimizations

## 3. Technical Details

### Genetic Representations for Economic Theorems

```

├─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬───────┤
│ TacticA │ TacticB │ TacticC │ TacticD │ TacticE │ ...   │
└─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴───────┘
```

Economic theorems require specific tactics:
- Real number arithmetic tactics for bounded values
- Summation tactics for WAR, DRP calculations
- Inequality reasoning for bounds proofs

### DeepSeek-Prover-V2 Integration for Economics

The DeepSeek-Prover-V2 integration will need to handle:
- Lean 4 economic definitions
- Finset/Finmap summation lemmas
- Inequality and bounded value reasoning

### O3 Optimization Performance Enhancements

Our genetic algorithm engine will leverage:
- Advanced caching described in O3 documentation
- Parallel processing for fitness evaluation
- Accelerated Monte Carlo simulations
