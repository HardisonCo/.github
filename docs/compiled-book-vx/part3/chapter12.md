The OpenAI key is now approved, stored, and visible to the right roles.  
Yet a single poisoned container‚Äîor an insider riding on a forgotten VPN‚Äîcould
still call the key-storage API and exfiltrate credentials, dragging us *back* to

Zero-Trust Security Model (‚Äúnever trust, always verify‚Äù) is `_ref`‚Äôs final
shield against exactly that disaster.  
Every HTTP call and inter-service hop‚Äîyes, even *inside* the NSF data center‚Äîis
forced to prove identity, privilege, encryption, and auditability.  
No proof ‚Üí no key ‚Üí no LLM call.  
Result: system functionality *and* federal compliance stay intact.

### Theorem Proving

The Theorem Proving provides essential functionality in the HMS ecosystem.

## 3. Technical Implementation: Building Theorem Proving & Formal Verification

shield against exactly that disaster.

## 1. Motivation ‚Äî Closing the Last Security Gap

Concrete NSF flow with the new key in place:

1. Analyst (`Verified`) presses **Generate Research Summary**.  
2. Browser calls `POST /ai/summary`.  
3. HMS-API must fetch `openai_primary` from the Vault.  
4. Vault must *re-verify* HMS-API‚Äôs identity *right now* (not just at pod
   start-up) before handing over the key.

Without Zero-Trust, step 4 might silently succeed for a hijacked container.
With Zero-Trust, the Vault challenges HMS-API on every request; any mismatch
kills the call, and the key stays safe.

## 2. Six Pillars in Plain English

| Pillar                 | One-line Explanation | Why NSF Cares for the LLM Key |
|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Strong Identity        | Mutual TLS + JWT on **every** hop | Stops impostor services grabbing the key |
| Least Privilege        | Scoped tokens (`ai:key:read`) | Even HMS-API can‚Äôt list *all* keys, only the one it needs |
| Micro-Segmentation     | Per-service network policies | Compromise of `stats-worker` can‚Äôt reach the Vault |
| Continuous Verification| Re-auth every request | Long-lived stolen JWTs become useless |
| End-to-End Encryption  | mTLS / TLS 1.3 | Keys & prompts unreadable in transit |
| Immutable Audit Logs   | Append-only, 7 yrs | GAO can replay *every* key access |

Keep these pillars handy; the code & diagrams below implement them.

---

## 3. How to Use It ‚Äî The `secure_call()` Wrapper

The easiest way for beginners to tap Zero-Trust is a **one-liner**:

```text

Input  
‚Ä¢ `target`  ‚Äì internal URL that will, behind the scenes, need the OpenAI key.  
‚Ä¢ `scope`   ‚Äì minimal permission string tied to the caller‚Äôs wristband.

Output  
‚Ä¢ Sanitised HTML summary **or** a detailed `AccessDenied` error explaining
  which Zero-Trust pillar failed.

### Under the hood (condensed)

1. Builds a short-lived JWT with the requested `scope`.  
2. Opens an mTLS channel to the ZT Gateway.  
3. Gateway re-verifies the token *and* network policy.  
4. Call is forwarded to HMS-API only if all six pillars pass.

---

## 4. Internal Flow for the Target Use Case

```

One failed check (red arrow) returns
`403 AccessDenied: pillar <name> failed`, never leaking the key.

---

## 5. Minimal Code Peeks (All ‚â§ 20 Lines)

### 5.1 secure_call() Helper

```text

### 5.2 Gateway Guard (excerpt)

```

## 6. Where Zero-Trust Touches Other HMS Components

Component | Interaction for the ‚ÄúOpenAI key‚Äù Flow
----------|---------------------------------------
[Stakeholder Access Model](11_stakeholder_access_model_five_wristbands_.md) | Wristband role becomes the `role` claim inside the short-lived JWT.
[Backend API (‚ÄúHeart‚Äù)](05_backend_api_heart_communication_hub_.md) | Reads keys *only* when the ZT Gateway has stamped the request.
[Real-Time Sync](06_real_time_synchronization_event_broadcast_.md) | Bus drops any envelope whose mTLS session or JWT fails ZT checks.
[AI Governance Framework](09_ai_governance_framework_.md) | Governance rules feed the Policy Engine (`budget ‚â§ $50/day`, etc.).
[Component Agent](10_component_agent_.md) | Sidecar containers inherit the same `secure_call()` wrapper to fetch policies & keys.

---

## 7. Analogy Corner üîê

Imagine NSF‚Äôs HQ as a **museum with laser tripwires**:

1. Every door badge proves *who you are* (identity).  
2. Each room unlocks only for curators who need it (least privilege).  
3. Lasers segment each gallery; crossing the wrong one triggers alarms
   (micro-segmentation).  
4. Guards scan badges *again* inside sensitive rooms (continuous verification).  
5. Thick walls muffle all conversations (encryption).  
6. Cameras film every step (audit logs).

Zero-Trust gives HMS those lasers‚Äîno skeleton keys, no dark corridors.

## 8. Quick FAQ

| Q | A |
|---|---|
| ‚ÄúCan I turn off mTLS in dev?‚Äù | Yes: set `ZT_OFF=true`, but CI & prod always force it. |
| ‚ÄúDoes this slow down LLM calls?‚Äù | Median overhead ‚âà 30 ms; far smaller than model latency itself. |
| ‚ÄúWhere are audit logs stored?‚Äù | Append-only `zt_audit` table in HMS-API (7-year retention). |

## 9. Summary & Transition

Zero-Trust finishes the security puzzle:

1. Every hop‚Äîbrowser to Vault‚Äîre-authenticates and encrypts.  
2. Only the **exact** services allowed to see `openai_primary` ever touch it.  
3. NSF can now flip the ‚ÄúGenerate Research Summary‚Äù button **on** with high
   confidence that neither insider mistakes nor external attackers will leak
   the key or the data.

With the perimeter locked, Chapter 13 shows how the same Zero-Trust rails power
the **Data Access API (Clean-Data Vending Machine)** so analysts can safely pull
datasets that fuel their new LLM workflows.
