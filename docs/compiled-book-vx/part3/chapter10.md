In Chapters 1-9 we secured, approved, and governed the new OpenAI path, yet one
last **system-functionality** gap lurks:

*The `llm-dispatcher` folder still hard-codes the old provider list  
(`["claude","gemini"]`) so the fresh key is simply ignored.*

A human could open vim, write a test, run CI, create a pull-request‚Ä¶  
‚Äîor‚Äî  
a **Component Agent** living *inside* that folder can do the fix completely
autonomously, minutes after AIGF‚Äôs green light.

## 1. Motivation ‚Äî How Component Agents Rescue the ‚ÄúMissing-Key‚Äù Scenario

Concrete NSF flow:

1. AIGF emits `proposalPassed(OpenAI_Enable)`.                (‚úì Chapter 9)  
2. Real-Time Sync shouts the event to every service.          (‚úì Chapter 6)  
3. **`llm-dispatcher` Component Agent** hears the shout,  
   realises its code doesn‚Äôt list `openai`, patches itself, runs tests, and
   merges the fix‚Äîall before the next analyst click.  

No pager, no midnight commit, no lingering  
‚ÄúUnable to generate content from LLM‚Äù banner.

## 2. Key Concepts Breakdown

| Power | What it means inside `llm-dispatcher` | Role in NSF use case |
|-------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|
| üìö Learn  | Reads its own folder with the Five-Pass method. | Knows where `SUPPORTED_PROVIDERS` lives. |
| üõ°Ô∏è Guard  | Runs unit tests & lint before any commit. | Confirms OpenAI calls work and Claude still passes. |
| üß© Reason | Thinks out loud with CoRT before touching code. | Decides *why* and *how* to add `"openai"`. |
| üó£Ô∏è Talk   | Exposes a one-line `ask()` API & chats on the Collaboration Interface. | Receives `proposalPassed` event and returns status to dashboards. |

---

## 3. How to Use a Component Agent (NSF-Focused Example)

Below is **everything** the Management layer does when AIGF passes:

```

Input  
‚Ä¢ `component` ‚Äî folder name.  
‚Ä¢ `goal`      ‚Äî plain English task tied to our use case.  

Output  
‚Ä¢ Nothing synchronous; the agent logs its work to
  `llm-dispatcher/agent/replies.md` and emits a `componentFixed` event when done.

---

## 4. What Happens Internally?

```text

Elapsed time on staging: **~90 s**.  
Before the next analyst hits ‚ÄúGenerate Research Summary,‚Äù the dispatcher now
routes prompts to OpenAI.

## 6. Component Agent in the HMS Ecosystem

Component | Interaction in This Chapter
----------|----------------------------
[Real-Time Synchronization](06_real_time_synchronization_event_broadcast_.md) | Delivers `proposalPassed` and later `componentFixed`.
[AI Governance Framework](09_ai_governance_framework_.md) | Its verdict triggers the agent task.
[Verification Mechanism](08_verification_mechanism_conveyor_belt_ci_gate_.md) | Agent must pass every gate before merging.
[Collaboration Interface](03_collaboration_interface_agent_dial_tone_.md) | `ask()` and `componentFixed` travel through the same 8-field envelope.
[Backend API (‚ÄúHeart‚Äù)](05_backend_api_heart_communication_hub_.md) | Stores the agent‚Äôs PR and event logs for audits.
[Zero-Trust Security Model](12_zero_trust_security_model_.md) | Sidecar runs in a locked-down namespace; agent has write-access only to its own folder.

## 7. Analogy Corner üè™

Think of each repo folder as a **small corner shop**:

‚Ä¢ The **Component Agent** is the shop-owner.  
‚Ä¢ When City Hall (AIGF) legalises a new product (OpenAI),  
  the owner updates price tags, trains staff, runs a quick fire drill  
  (tests), and re-opens‚Äîall without calling corporate HQ at 3 a.m.

---

## 8. Quick FAQ

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| ‚ÄúDo agents ever edit code outside their folder?‚Äù | No‚Äîguard rails block cross-folder commits unless another agent explicitly invites collaboration. |
| ‚ÄúWhat if tests fail?‚Äù | The agent auto-reverts the branch and logs a `componentError` event so humans can step in. |
| ‚ÄúCan humans still push manually?‚Äù | Absolutely; agents complement, not replace, human contributors. CI treats both equally. |

## 9. Key Takeaways

1. **Component Agents** are self-contained shop-owners that read, fix, test, and
   merge code inside a single folder.  
2. In our NSF scenario, the `llm-dispatcher` agent autonomously adds OpenAI
   support the moment governance approves the key‚Äîclosing the last
   system-functionality gap.  
3. Less midnight firefighting, faster feature availability, fully auditable.

### Up Next ‚Üí Chapter 11

Now that autonomous agents are editing code, we must ensure each human (and
agent) only touches what their clearance allows.  
Chapter 11 introduces the **Stakeholder Access Model (Five Wristbands)**‚Äîyour
color-coded guide to permission boundaries.

## 4. Hands-On Example: Using Genetic Algorithms & Self-Healing Systems

Below is **everything** the Management layer does when AIGF passes:

```python
## management/openai_rollout.py   (‚â§16 lines)
from agents.ask import ask              # universal helper

## Tell the llm-dispatcher agent to add OpenAI support
ask(
    component="llm-dispatcher",
    user="automation@hms",
    goal="Add provider 'openai_primary' to SUPPORTED_PROVIDERS list "
         "and update tests"
)

```
Input  
‚Ä¢ `component` ‚Äî folder name.  
‚Ä¢ `goal`      ‚Äî plain English task tied to our use case.  

Output  
‚Ä¢ Nothing synchronous; the agent logs its work to
  `llm-dispatcher/agent/replies.md` and emits a `componentFixed` event when done.
