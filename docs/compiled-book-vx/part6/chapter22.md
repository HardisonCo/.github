> ## 1. Introduction: The Challenge of Cross-Language Integration & FFI

This document describes the Foreign Function Interface (FFI) integration for the Trade Balance system, which enables the Win-Win Calculation Framework to be used from multiple programming languages.

## 2. Key Concepts: Understanding Cross-Language Integration & FFI

### Cross-Language Integration

The Cross-Language Integration provides essential functionality in the HMS ecosystem.

## 3. Technical Implementation: Building Cross-Language Integration & FFI

### Implementation Components

The FFI integration consists of the following components:

### 1. Rust Implementation (`trade_balance_core` crate)

The core implementation in pure Rust, which provides:
- Data structures for entity profiles, value components, and analysis results
- Entity-specific value translation for different entity types (Government, Corporate, NGO, Civilian)
- Win-Win calculation and deal analysis
- Value distribution optimization
- Deal improvement suggestions

```json
#include "hms_trade_balance.h"
#include <stdio.h> int main() {

    char result_buffer[8192];
    
    // Analyze a deal
    int status = hms_trade_balance_analyze_win_win(
        entity_profiles_json,
        value_components_json,
        result_buffer,
        sizeof(result_buffer)
    );
    
    if (status == HMS_SUCCESS) {
        printf("Analysis result: %s\n", result_buffer);
    }
    
    return 0;
}

json
import hms_core
import json

## Create entity profiles and value components
entity_profiles = { ... }
value_components = { ... }

## Analyze the deal
analysis_result = hms_core.trade_balance_analyze_win_win_py(
    json.dumps(entity_profiles),
    json.dumps(value_components)
)

## Check if win-win
print(f"Is win-win: {analysis_result['is_win_win']}")
```
## 4. Hands-On Example: Using Cross-Language Integration & FFI

Example code showing how to use the FFI bindings:
- `/examples/trade_balance_core_demo.rs` - Rust example
- `/examples/trade_balance_python_demo.py` - Python example
- `/examples/trade_balance_c_demo.c` - C example
