|--------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **Resilience** | Automatic recovery rate | > 95% of failure modes | Self-healing success logs |
| | Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) | < 3 minutes | Recovery time measurements |
| **Theorem Proving** | Success rate on complex theorems | > 80% | Benchmark results |
| | Proof elegance | 30% improvement over baseline | Elegance metrics |
| **Compliance** | Policy verification coverage | 100% | Verification records |
| | Formal verification success | > 95% | DeepSeek-Prover results |
| **Performance** | End-to-end proving time | 50% reduction | Benchmarking suite |
| | Resource efficiency | 30% improvement | System monitoring |
| **Scalability** | Concurrent theorem handling | > 500 theorems | Load testing |
| | Agent population size | Up to 10,000 | Kubernetes scaling tests |

### 1.3 Strategic Objectives

1. **Unified Architecture**: Create a seamless integration of Economic Theorem Proving with Genetic Agents (ETP-GA) into the HMS ecosystem
2. **Self-Healing Intelligence**: Implement advanced self-diagnosis and recovery mechanisms for theorem proving
3. **Evolutionary Optimization**: Leverage genetic algorithms to continuously improve proving strategies
4. **Formal Verification**: Ensure mathematical correctness through rigorous proof checking
5. **Compliant Governance**: Maintain policy compliance and human oversight through HMS's verification framework

## 3. Genetic Self-Healing Framework

### 3.1 Self-Healing Capabilities

The unified system will implement advanced self-healing capabilities specifically designed for genetic-based theorem proving:

#### 3.1.1 Detection Mechanisms

- **Convergence Monitoring**: Detect stalled evolution or convergence plateaus
- **Resource Utilization**: Identify excessive resource consumption patterns
- **Verification Failures**: Track unsuccessful proof verification attempts
- **Genetic Diversity**: Monitor population diversity and prevent premature convergence
- **Timeout Detection**: Identify theorems taking excessive time to prove

#### 3.1.2 Diagnostic Capabilities

- **Root Cause Analysis**: Determine whether failures stem from genetic algorithm parameters, theorem complexity, resource constraints, or verification issues
- **Failure Categorization**: Classify failures into patterns for targeted remediation
- **Performance Profiling**: Identify bottlenecks in the proving process
- **Genetic Analysis**: Assess population health and genetic trait distributions

#### 3.1.3 Recovery Strategies

- **Genetic Intervention**: Modify mutation rates, introduce new genetic material, or reset portions of the population
- **Theorem Decomposition**: Break complex theorems into manageable sub-problems
- **Resource Reallocation**: Adjust computing resources based on theorem complexity
- **Strategy Switching**: Change proving strategies based on theorem characteristics
- **Checkpoint Restoration**: Return to last known good state when progress is lost

#### 3.1.4 Preventive Measures

- **Adaptive Parameters**: Continuously adjust genetic parameters based on performance
- **Diversity Preservation**: Enforce minimum diversity requirements in the population
- **Resource Forecasting**: Predict resource needs to prevent exhaustion
- **Pre-verification**: Validate intermediate proof steps to catch errors early

### 3.2 Genetic Evolution Framework

The genetic algorithm framework will be enhanced and tightly integrated with HMS's supervisory control:

#### 3.2.1 Enhanced Genetic Model

- **Hierarchical Genotypes**: Structured genetic traits organized by theorem aspects
- **Multi-objective Fitness**: Balance correctness, completeness, elegance, and efficiency
- **Adaptive Operators**: Context-aware mutation and crossover based on theorem domain
- **Meta-evolution**: Evolution of genetic parameters themselves
- **Specialized Gene Pools**: Maintain specialized sub-populations for different theorem types

#### 3.2.2 Evolution Control Mechanisms

- **Supervisor-managed Evolution**: HMS Supervisor controls evolution pace and direction
- **Policy-guided Selection**: Selection pressure aligned with system policies
- **Verification-validated Fitness**: Formal verification results influence fitness scores
- **Resource-aware Scheduling**: Evolution proceeds based on available resources
- **Human-guided Direction**: HITL interfaces allow expert guidance of evolution
