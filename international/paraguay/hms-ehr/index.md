# HMS-EHR Integration with Paraguay Healthcare System

## Overview

The HMS-EHR (Electronic Health Records) component provides a comprehensive clinical data management solution tailored to Paraguay's healthcare ecosystem. This integration enables healthcare providers across public, social security, and private sectors to capture, manage, and exchange patient health information efficiently while addressing the country's unique linguistic, geographic, and infrastructure challenges.

## Current EHR Landscape in Paraguay

Paraguay's electronic health record adoption is characterized by significant disparities:

### Public Sector (MSPBS)
- Limited EHR adoption (approximately 30% of facilities)
- Fragmented implementation with minimal standardization
- Basic functionality focused on demographic data and visit recording
- Minimal clinical decision support capabilities
- Limited interoperability between facilities

### Social Security (IPS)
- Higher EHR adoption (approximately 65% of facilities)
- Proprietary systems with limited external connectivity
- Focus on administrative and billing processes
- Inconsistent clinical documentation standards
- Concentrated in urban areas

### Private Sector
- Variable adoption based on provider size and location
- Multiple vendor solutions with minimal interoperability
