# HMS-NFO Integration with Paraguay Healthcare System

## Overview

The HMS-NFO (Network Foundation Operations) component serves as the core infrastructure for Paraguay's healthcare data management, providing a unified information foundation across the country's fragmented healthcare landscape. This integration enables reliable data exchange, secure access controls, and sophisticated analytics capabilities to support improved healthcare decision-making nationwide.

## Paraguay's Healthcare Data Landscape

### Current State Assessment

Paraguay's healthcare data ecosystem is characterized by:
